Our Annual Picnic has been pushed out to October 17th, when hopefully the weather will be more
predictable!  We promise it will be worth waiting for!  Meanwhile, we have lots of other get
togethers on the the [events calendar]({{ site.baseurl }}/events).

In addition to our regularly scheduled meet & greets at area [Petco](http://www.petco.com/)
and [Tomlinson](http://www.tomlinsons.com/) stores, we will be at the
[Mueller Farmer’s Market](http://texasfarmersmarket.org/mueller/) on Mother’s Day,
*Sunday May 10th from 9am until 1pm*.  We will have special treats for all the moms. ❤️

Please join us at the [Doghouse Drinkery and Dog Park](http://www.doghousedrinkery.com/)
on *June 6th at 10:30 am* for our next membership meeting and playdate.
If you have never been, The Doghouse was created by a dog-lover with 20 years experience in
the pet industry.  At The Doghouse, you can hang with friends and catch a game while your dog
enjoys a clean, off-leash play park.

See you there!

When it’s too hot to play outside, we will have a “Painting With a Twist” party coming up on
*August 2nd*.  This one is just for the humans.
