## BUY ONE, GIVE ONE to the Hounds!

[![Dogs by the Bay](/img/dogsbythebay.jpg)](https://www.etsy.com/shop/dogsbythebay)

On Friday 11/27, our friends at [Dogs by the Bay](https://www.etsy.com/shop/dogsbythebay) are
running a special promotion.
For every collar you order that day, Dogs by the Bay will donate a collar to a shelter or adoption group of your choice.
The donated collar will be in the same style and size as the purchased collar,
but in a cute, brightly colored “Adopt Me” pattern for our foster dogs.
<br>You just need to indicate _GPA Central Texas_ in the notes to the seller when you check out.

Our foster dogs can sure use some new duds, and you were going to get Fido a new holiday collar
anyhow, right?
