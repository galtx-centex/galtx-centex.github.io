There will be burgers and brats (and vegetarian option, too) cooking on the grill.
Please bring a side dish and a lawn chair.

We will have lots of fun activities for the whole family,  including a photo booth, kids
crafts, a doggies costume contest and more!  There will also be a couple of special greyhound
