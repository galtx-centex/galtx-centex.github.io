SPRING HAS SPRUNG!
------------------

**MORE** retiring and rescued greyhounds are on their way to us and are in need of a soft place to land.
If you have considered fostering, NOW is the time to make a difference in a greyhound's life.
Please send your foster application to: [foster@gpa-centex.org](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org)

GPA-Central Texas ALWAYS needs caring foster homes, particularly homes without cats (but homes with cats are still
needed, too!). GPA-CT provides the basic supplies; you provide food, lessons on home life, bed, safety, warmth,
affection, and training for becoming someone's forever companion.

If you've ever thought of volunteering by opening your home to a foster in need of learning how to be a pet, now is a
GREYT time! Please contact GPA-CT Foster Coordinator at [foster@gpa-centex.org](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org)
for more information.

Foster families are our most important volunteers. Without them, GPA-CT cannot fulfill its mission. Foster families open
their homes to newly retired greyhounds, helping them adjust to a life of retirement. Greyhounds are very intelligent
and learn very quickly, particularly when given daily affection. Foster families volunteer to share their lives with a
greyhound until they are ready to be adopted and are rewarded with knowing they helped one more hound find their
forever home.

Foster families help GPA-CT get to know the dogs and find out what their personalities are before they are placed in
their new homes. During the time they are in foster care, the greyhounds are taken to the veterinarian, get their
annual shots, are spayed or neutered, have their teeth cleaned, are tested for heartworms and put on heartworm
preventative. During their visit, they are also evaluated for any injuries or health problems. Once this is done,
GPA-CT begins the process of finding a home for the greyhound, and the foster family plays a big role in ensuring the
right placement of the greyhound.

The main limitation on the number of dogs GPA-CT can bring into its adoption program is the number of volunteer foster
families. If you would like to volunteer to foster a newly retired racing greyhound, please contact the
[Placement Coordinator](mailto:placement@gpa-centex.org) or [Foster Coordinator](mailto:foster@gpa-centex.org)
