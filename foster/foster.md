**MORE** retiring and rescued greyhounds are on their way to us and are in need of a soft place
to land. If you have considered fostering, NOW is the time to make a difference in a greyhound's
life. Please send your foster application (download below) to:
[foster@galtx-centex.org](mailto:foster@galtx-centex.org).

GALT-Central Texas ALWAYS needs caring foster homes (with or without cats!). GALT-Central Texas provides the
basic supplies; you provide lessons on home life, bed, safety, warmth, affection, and
training for becoming someone's forever companion. [Tomlinson's](http://www.tomlinsons.com/)
has generously donated food for our foster families, so now there is absolutely no monetary cost to fostering.

Greyhounds are very intelligent and learn
very quickly, particularly when given daily affection.  During the time they are in foster
care, the greyhounds are taken to the veterinarian, get their annual shots, are spayed or
neutered, have their teeth cleaned, are tested for heartworms and put on heartworm
preventative. During their visit, they are also evaluated for any injuries or health problems.
Once this is done, GALT-Central Texas begins the process of finding a home for the greyhound, and the
foster family plays a big role in ensuring the right placement of the greyhound.

Foster families are our most important volunteers. Without them, GALT-Central Texas cannot fulfill its
mission. The main limitation on the number of dogs GALT-Central Texas can bring into its adoption program
is the number of volunteer foster families. If you would like to volunteer to foster a newly
retired racing greyhound, please review the Foster FAQs below.

    <h2>Testimonials from Foster Families:</h2>

    <i>
    <blockquote>
    "What a rewarding experience!  There's just something amazing about giving a greyhound their
    first off-track experience, and showing them what family and home are all about.  Their soulful
    eyes and the appreciation they show is beyond gratitude.  After a couple of days, they adapt to
    life as a pet so quickly -- like they were born to live with you.  If you're reading this, take
    the first step and become a foster and see for yourself."

    <blockquote>
    "I have had so much fun fostering greyhounds. I love to see them take their first steps in a house.
    I would imagine the thrill I have in seeing them play with a toy for the first time in their lives,
    conquer going up and down stairs, or finally being able to enter a room without being spooked by
    the ceiling fan, is probably a little like seeing your child take their first steps. They just
    seem to find such joy in the little things. I never get tired of watching that transition."

    <blockquote>
    "It was such a joy to watch my timid little foster become a confident, happy girl. Helping
    this beautiful animal adjust to life off the track has been an incredibly gratifying experience."
