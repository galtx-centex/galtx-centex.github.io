  <h1>Foster FAQs</h1>
</div>

<h2 id="what-is-fostering">What is fostering?</h2>
<p>Ex-racing greyhounds have most likely never been inside a home before. Your job
as a foster parent is to take them into your home, treat them with love, and
train them to be a well-behaved house pet. They might come into your lives for
a few weeks, or a few months, but watching their personalities bloom is a rich
reward. Knowing that they’ll be successful in their new forever home because of
your efforts makes it easier to let them go when it’s time.</p>

<h2 id="what-supplies-does-galt-central-texas-provide-for-my-foster-dog">What supplies does GALT-Central Texas provide for my foster dog?</h2>
<p>GALT-Central Texas will supply a black Martingale collar, black 4’ leash,
GALT-Central Texas ID tag, muzzle, belly band (for male dogs), monthly
heartworm preventative, and monthly flea/tick preventative. A GALT-Central
Texas crate will be available to borrow if you need one. If you need help with
the food for your foster, that can also be arranged.</p>

<h2 id="what-supplies-do-i-need-to-provide-for-my-foster-dog">What supplies do I need to provide for my foster dog?</h2>
<p>You will need to provide soft dog bedding, food and clean water, a crate,
treats, toys, elevated bowls, and most importantly lots of love and affection.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-my-foster-go-about-getting-adopted">How will my foster go about getting adopted?</h2>
<p>The adoption coordinators work hard to match potential adopters with an
available greyhound. As a foster parent, you are an integral part of that
process in several ways. First, by getting your foster out to meet &amp; greet
events so people can be introduced to her. Second, by keeping the foster and
adoption coordinator informed about your foster’s personality and habits so a
good match can be made. Third, by filling out the Foster Profile Form, which is
heavily used as a resource by the adoption coordinators.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-decide-i-want-to-adopt-my-foster-dog">What if I decide I want to adopt my foster dog?</h2>
<p>That’s a wonderful decision to make! If you decide you’d like to make a foster
dog a permanent member of your family, contact a foster or adoption coordinator
so we can take him off the list of available greyhounds. “Failing fostering” is
a greyt way to add to your family - it’s not a failure at all!</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-my-foster-needs-medical-attention">What should I do if my foster needs medical attention?</h2>
<p>If your foster needs emergency medical attention for a life-threatening
situation, seek medical attention for her at the nearest emergency clinic
immediately and contact us when you can. Otherwise, contact a medical
coordinator so they can give you medical advice or set up a vet appointment if
necessary. GALT-Central Texas uses a certain set of vets for care because they
are kind enough to donate or discount their services for us - helping keep our
costs down lets us help more greyhounds.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-take-my-foster-dog-to-a-dog-park">Can I take my foster dog to a dog park?</h2>
<p>Dog parks can be a dangerous environment. It is GALT-Central Texas policy that
a foster dog should not be taken to a dog park. We cannot afford to be liable
if a foster dog is involved in an incident. Dog parks are also fertile grounds
for picking up intestinal parasites, fleas, or ticks. A romp in the back yard
or a daily walk is enough exercise for a greyhound, believe it or not! They are
retired and do not need serious running to stay happy and healthy.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-that-a-dog-is-on-injured-reserve">What does it mean that a dog is on injured reserve?</h2>
<p>Some greyhounds need a little extra recuperation time. Some of them come from
the track with a broken leg or other injuries. Others have tick-borne diseases
or heartworm. These dogs need some TLC and time to get well. They might be on
restricted activity, need frequent vet visits, or special medications. Injured
reserve dogs do not attend meet &amp; greet events. They are not considered
available for adoption until they have recovered.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-feed-my-foster-dog">What should I feed my foster dog?</h2>
<p>Providing lots of fresh, clean water and a high-quality dry food (kibble) is an
important part of caring for your foster dog. Good foods will have a meat or
meat product as at least two of the first four ingredients. The ingredients
should not include corn, wheat, or by-products. Adding a little water to the
kibble just before you serve it helps it go down easier. You could also mix in
a little canned food in to provide moisture or a little extra incentive for
picky eaters. Adding a spoonful of yogurt can help with gas sometimes, and a
spoonful of pumpkin can be a good remedy if your foster is suffering from loose
stools. Some good brands: Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild,
Kirkland (from Costco), or Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover’s Soul.</p>

<h2 id="should-my-foster-be-this-skinny">Should my foster be this skinny?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds have a slender build and a fast metabolism. You should be able to
see the last 2 or 3 ribs and feel the points of the hip bones. Being overweight
causes health issues. A typical greyhound should eat 3 to 4 cups of food a day,
depending on their size and activity level. Your foster might need to gain or
lose weight when you first get them - be observant and raise/lower their food
amount as necessary. Remember treats count too when it comes to calories.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-really-need-to-use-a-crate">Do I really need to use a crate?</h2>
<p>A crate gives a foster dog a place to call their own. For some it is a haven -
a place they can go to feel comfortable and safe. Retired racers are used to a
kennel environment. A crate is also a useful way to separate dogs when
necessary. We recommend using a crate when your foster dog will be home alone.
Crate training for your foster keeps all your pets safe when you’re out of the
house, and keeps him out of trouble until he learns to be a polite house guest.
Your foster does not need to sleep in the crate at night - sleeping in your
bedroom on a dog bed will help him bond and also make it easy for you to tell
if he’s restless at night.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-you-supply-a-muzzle">Why do you supply a muzzle?</h2>
<p>Greyhounds are used to wearing muzzles during turn-outs and races. A muzzle is
a useful tool for keeping your foster and other greyhounds out of trouble when
they’re zooming around the yard, or learning how to behave in the house. They
can still drink water while they’re wearing a muzzle. Putting a muzzle on your
foster greyhound is not a cruel act - it’s preventing trouble and setting her
up for success. If you have more than one dog in the house, please remember
that if one is muzzled, all should be muzzled.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-belly-band">What’s a belly band?</h2>
<p>Think of a belly band as a little diaper for male dogs. Some male dogs will
want to mark in the house, and a belly band will help prevent damage to your
furniture and belongings until they have learned that your house is their home
and they should only mark outside the house.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-teach-my-foster">What do I need to teach my foster?</h2>
<p>Your foster dog will need to learn new skills since a new foster has likely
never been in a house before. They will need to master house-training, learn
not to counter-surf, understand what they can and can’t chew on, and obey the
no-furniture rule. They also need to be able to walk calmly on leash, and know
how to behave when left home alone.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-i-need-to-leave-town-for-a-trip">What if I need to leave town for a trip?</h2>
<p>If you’re going to be away from home, please notify a foster coordinator. Three
to four weeks notice is appreciated if possible. We will need to arrange for
your foster to stay at another foster home during your absence. Please do not
leave your foster with a dog-sitter, friend, or neighbor without getting prior
approval from a coordinator. We need to know where your foster is in case they
need to meet a potential adopter.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-like-my-fosters-name-can-i-call-him-fido">I don’t like my foster’s name, can I call him fido?</h2>
<p>GALT-Central Texas owns your foster dog, and has given him a name. This is the
name used to identify him on the website, in our files, at the vet, and when
talking to potential adopters. Your foster needs to learn to respond to the
name he has been given. Feel free to add a few nicknames, but make sure he
knows his GALT-Central Texas name and use that name when communicating with the
coordinators or potential adopters. Anything else causes confusion.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-do-to-correct-bad-behavior">What should I do to correct bad behavior?</h2>
<p>GALT-Central Texas advocates positive reinforcement based training. You should
never physically discipline your foster dog. A firm “NO”, eye contact, and/or a
squirt-bottle of water should be enough to deter these sensitive dogs. If you
need advice on a specific problem, let us know so we can provide it or put you
in contact with a behavior specialist.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-recommended-books-on-greyhounds-or-dog-training">What are some recommended books on greyhounds or dog training?</h2>
<p>There are a host of good books out there. We especially recommend Adopting the
Racing Greyhound by Cynthia Brannigan and Retired Racing Greyhounds for Dummies
by Lee Livingood. Non-greyhound specific books: Getting Started: Clicker
Training for Dogs by Karen Pryor, Canine Body Language by Brenda Aloff, and
Family Friendly Dog Training by Patricia McConnell.</p>

<h2 id="wont-i-get-too-attached">Won’t I get too attached?</h2>
<p>Fostering is a labor of love, and it can be very difficult to say goodbye. But
it helps to tell yourself “This is not my dog. I’m only keeping it for a while
for someone else.” When we feel the excitement from a new adopter, and know our
foster greyhound is going to a loving home, that makes it bearable to see them
move one. Plus, then you get to help another greyhound find their home!
Adopting helps one dog, fostering helps many.</p>
