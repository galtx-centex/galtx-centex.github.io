## FOSTER HOMES FOR RETIRING GREYHOUNDS ARE _ALWAYS_ NEEDED!

The more foster homes we have, the more Greyhounds we can prepare for forever homes.

### What Makes a Good Foster Home?

A place where the Greyhound will be given the same food, water, shelter, love and attention you would give your own pet.
A home in which the people patiently and compassionately teach the retired racer about life as a pet. These special dogs are
making an adjustment from living on a farm or in racing kennels to living in a home.  They may need an introduction to some
things you and your pet take for granted, like mirrors, wood floors, carpet, glass doors, pet doors, soft beds and toys. It may take
them a little time to get comfortable in this new environment with all new stimuli.

### I've never had a greyhound before. Can I foster?

Absolutely. It helps to have some experience with dogs in general, but having your own pet greyhound or prior experience
with the breed is not required.

### Can I become a foster parent if I have cats?

Yes. Many greyhounds do well with cats.  We cat test the dogs before placing them in
foster homes, so if you have cat(s) you will only foster cat-safe dogs.

### Can we foster if we have other breeds of dogs?

Yes. Most greyhounds get along well with other breeds of dogs, big and small.  We can use homes with all kinds of
situations (cats, no cats, other dogs or not, children or not). Greyhounds have various
personalities and needs; we test each dog prior to foster placement.

### I've heard greyhounds are really active and need a lot of exercise. Is that true?

No!  Greyhounds have shorts bursts of energy and then rest a lot. They are often referred to as
“40 mph couch potatoes”. Taking them out on longer walks a few times a week should
be adequate exercise.

### Do I have to have spacious house with a large yard?

No. Many greyhounds live happily in apartments, town homes and condos. **A Backyard is NOT Required!**
However, if you do have a backyard, it must be completely fenced with a minimum 4-foot fence,
6-foot preferred, as Greyhounds can reach full speed in under 3 seconds.
Otherwise, 3 or 4 short, on-leash walks per day should suffice.

### Do I have to own my home to foster greyhounds?

No, but you must have permission from your property manager to have pets. GALT-Central Texas does not pay for any
additional pet deposits or rent increases.

### What do I do with my foster dog if I have to go out of town or on vacation?

You may travel by car with the dog if you wish, or another GALT-Central Texas foster parent will sub-foster
for you. Please notify the Foster Coordinator of travel plans; request in advance if a sub-foster is needed.

### How old are the foster dogs?

The dogs mostly range in age from 1-5 years old, with 2-3 being typical. Occasionally seniors
and special needs dogs become available and need experienced homes.

### How long are greyhounds in foster care?

Normally, a dog is in foster care from 2-12 weeks, usually 3-4 weeks.

### What are my financial obligations to the foster dog and GALT-Central Texas?

Minimal. [Tomlinson's](http://www.tomlinsons.com/) has generously donated food for our foster families, so most of your
obligations will be fresh water, a quiet place to rest inside your home, and time
for walks, treats, brushing, and affection, plus at least once per month visit to meet and
greet events. Occasional transport for veterinary follow-up may be necessary.

### What if I want to keep my foster dog?

Can I adopt him/her? Fostering is a good way to find out if adopting a Greyhound is right
for you! Many foster families fall in love with one (or 2 or 3) of their foster dogs and end up
adopting them. You will just need to fill out an adoption application and pay the adoption
fee—be prompt, before someone else falls for your foster! We hope you'll continue to
foster other dogs after adopting; many people do!

### What if my foster dog gets sick or injured?

GALT-Central Texas funds veterinary care for greyhounds in foster care. Contact the GALT-Central Texas Foster
Coordinator who will schedule an appointment for your foster dog at an
approved vet clinic in your area.
