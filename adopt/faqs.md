* Non-refundable adoption fee of $750 for Greyhounds (incl. Irish, Australian, Domestic)
* Non-refundable adoption fee of $450 for Greyhounds age 7 and up

the adoption donation fee at the time of the adoption. The preferred method of
payment is through PayPal.  You may also pay by cash or check.

## Why does GALT-Central Texas require an adoption deposit?
The $75 adoption application deposit ensures that you are serious in your
desire to adopt a greyhound. We spend a lot of effort checking references and
vet records. $25 of the $75 is non-refundable as it goes to cover the
administrative costs of processing your application. The $75 will be applied to
your adoption donation fee at the time of adoption.

## What standard medical care does GALT-Central Texas provide before adoption?
GALT-Central Texas has high standards for the health and welfare of our
greyhounds. GALT-Central Texas's average medical cost per greyhound is well
over $500 and includes the following: 

* Blood work: CBC (complete blood count) with serum chemistry panel for senior dogs
* Heartworm test (and treatment if necessary) 
* Fecal test (and treatment if necessary) 
* Spay or neuter
* Microchip implanted 
* Dental cleaning and extractions as needed
* All vaccinations, including DHLPP, Rabies, Canine Flu, and Bordetella
* Monthly heartworm preventative and flea/tick preventative

## What will I get when I adopt a greyhound from GALT-Central Texas?
* One greyhound who is as healthy as we can make him!

* Rabies certificate and tag

## If I've adopted from GALT-Central Texas before do I need to fill out the application again?
Yes. Anyone interested in adoption should complete the online application and
submit the deposit. This will result in your name being added to the current
potential adopters listing. If you are interested in a specific dog, please add
that to the application so your preferences can be noted by our adoption
coordinators.

## Will GALT-Central Texas adopt to an out-of-town or out-of-state applicant?
No, we simply do not have the volunteer resources to accomplish this.

## How long does the application approval process take?
Keep in mind that GALT-Central Texas relies on volunteers to process
applications. Applications are reviewed in the order that they are submitted.
If our volunteers are able to easily reach your references, the preliminary
approval can usually be obtained in a month or less. The second step of the approval
process is to narrow down your preferences and determine which dog may fit your environment.
