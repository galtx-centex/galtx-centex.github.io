## How much is the adoption fee?
GALT-Central Texasâ€™s non-refundable tax-deductible adoption donation fee is:

* $350 for all greyhounds under 7 years
* $275 for greyhounds ages 7, 8 and 9
* $225 for greyhounds ages 10 and up

Your $75 application deposit is applied to
the adoption donation fee at the time of the adoption. The preferred method of
payment is through PayPal.  You may also pay by cash or check.

## Why does GALT-Central Texas require an adoption deposit?
The $75 adoption application deposit ensures that you are serious in your
desire to adopt a greyhound. We spend a lot of effort checking references and
vet records. $25 of the $75 is non-refundable as it goes to cover the
administrative costs of processing your application. The $75 will be applied to
your adoption donation fee at the time of adoption.

## What standard medical care does GALT-Central Texas provide before adoption?
GALT-Central Texas has high standards for the health and welfare of our

## If I've adopted from GALT-Central Texas before do I need to fill out the application again?
Yes. Anyone interested in adoption should complete the online application and
submit the deposit. This will result in your name being added to the current
potential adopters listing. If you are interested in a specific dog, please add
that to the application so your preferences can be noted by our adoption
coordinators.

## Will GALT-Central Texas adopt to an out-of-town or out-of-state applicant?
Yes, GALT-Central Texas will and has adopted to out-of-town and out-of-state
applicants. We do require that a home check be completed and we will work with
volunteers in your area to accomplish this. Additionally, we require the
applicant to come to Austin or Dallas to pick up their greyhound and complete
the adoption.

## How long does the application approval process take?
Keep in mind that GALT-Central Texas relies on volunteers to process
applications. Applications are reviewed in the order that they are submitted.
If our volunteers are able to easily reach your references, the preliminary
approval can usually be obtained within a week. The second step of the approval
process is to narrow down your preferences for your new hound and coordinate a
home check.
