<h2>Dr. Ransom Emergency Medical Fund</h2>
<p>
On September 17, 2005, Greyhound Pets of Americaâ€“Central Texas lost a long-time devoted friend
when Dr. Real Ransom, DVM and his wife were killed in a plane crash near Houston. Dr. Ransom
had been associated with GPA Central Texas since 1992 and was the founder of Great Oaks Animal
Hospital. Over the years, he gave generously of his time and services to the foster dogs in our
program and provided support to many of GPA-CT's members. He is particularly remembered for his
warmth and compassion.
<p>
To honor his commitment and service to greyhounds, GPA-CT established the Real Ransom III DVM
Emergency Medical Fund. All donations to this fund have been used exclusively for special needs
greyhounds in foster care or in special cases after adoption.
<p>
If you have an extenuating circumstance, please contact <a href="mailto:president@gpa-centex.org">president@gpa-centex.org</a>
to apply for this fund.
