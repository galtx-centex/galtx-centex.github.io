title: Happy Thanksgiving!

Join us for the Barnes & Noble Gift Wrapping [throughout December!](http://gpa-centex.org/events/)

This is our second largest fundraiser of the year.  Last year we made over $2,000 through the
generosity of Barnes & Noble, the nimble fingers of our volunteer elves, and of course,
greyhounds wearing antlers!

There will be shifts available both at the Arboretum and Sunset Valley locations.

[Nicole](http://gpa-centex.org/greyhounds/nicole/) will be hanging her Christmas stocking right
where you see her in this photo, in her home with Sandra Hense.  Sandra has fostered eight
lovely ladies for us over the past two years.  Several of these gorgeous gals required extra
TLC which is Sandraâ€™s specialty.  She enjoys seeing their personalities unfold with time and
trust.  Thanks Sandra and Congratulations Nicole!

Hapi Underwood sure lived up to her name by bringing much happiness into the home of Beth and
Jon.  She is waiting at the Bridge with so many others that were lucky enough to join Castle
Underwood.
