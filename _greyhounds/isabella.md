Bella is a gregarious girl.  She enjoys meeting all breeds of dogs, large or small. We think she could even live with a cat, though she has only had brief encounters with cats so far. She has great leash manners, and is reliable with going potty on schedule and being left alone for short periods.  We have learned she does not like the crate (unusual for a grey), but has been trustworthy without it.  Bella can climb a few steps without problem; she could probably learn to do a full flight, just hasn't had the need to.  Bella is rather vocal for a greyhound, which means she might not be the best choice for apartment living.  She just has a lot to say.  If you are looking for someone to talk to, Bella may be your girl. You may need to mute your "Zoom" calls though.
