Krissy (All we want for xmas) was recently relinquished through no fault of her own. This spunky 8-year-old girl knows all about living in a home...her house manners are perfect! She does not need a crate. She has had zero accidents in the house, doesn’t get on furniture, doesn’t beg, jump, chew, or counter surf. She sleeps quietly through the night, and most of the day!
She has a recurring issue with corns on her feet, and has an old injury on a back foot. She still does enjoy short walks!
Krissy needs another dog with her. She does not like to be alone. She loves people too, and will always be close by, following us from room to room. She will let you know when it’s time for a petting...she will whine and paw at you. It’s very cute!
Krissy’s little face has a lot of character, with her pronounced “Roman” nose! This gal has a lot of love to give-she will thrive in a secure and loving home!
