G'day to this Aussie import! Trent is a sweet boy with deep soulful eyes. He loves collecting toys and will place them around the house in his favored lounging spots. He loves the outdoors, watching birds and squirrels. We will require a 6ft fence for this guy, as he is pretty good jumper when his prey drive is engaged. Trent will kennel up when you need to leave the house, and he also will go lounge in there with the door open, when he needs a little alone time. He is a man who appreciates comfort, so he would like blankets and soft toys in his man cave. Trent is fascinated by windows and TV screens and will sometimes "boop" noses with the handsome fella on the other side. Being a young lad, so far from his birthplace, he is still learning. He will thrive on routine and positive affirmation. Trent will show his pleasure with the fast beat of his happy, helicopter tail.
