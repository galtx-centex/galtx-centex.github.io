Harper is an absolutley gorgeous young lurcher with a sheen to her black coat.  She has a good bit of puppy-like energy, but tries very hard to do the right thing.  With time and training, she will learn to control her silly impulses.  She already responds well to verbal corrections. Providing her with an outlet for her youthful energy,  will go a long way with helping indoor, quiet behavior. She would make a great hiking buddy as she has more stamina than our other Greyhounds.
