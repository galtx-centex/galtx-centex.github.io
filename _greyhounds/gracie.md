I am a lover! I could just stand by your side and lovingly rest my head on your leg or simply gaze into your eyes all day! 
I love to be petted and rubbed or to chill and take a little nap on my favorite rug. I get along with cats, 
and am becoming BFFs with my foster brother Chewy the German shepherd. We play in the backyard everyday! 
I also love my little 5 pound foster sister Zuzu the poodle. So many new experiences and new friends! 
I look forward to meeting my forever family and falling in love with them!
