Pepper is a spicy gal, full of personality.  Twelve years young, this sprightly lady is full of life and has all
the energy of a six-year old dog.  She enjoys walks, is very interested in chasing squirrels and other small critters;
large and small dog friendly, but probably not cat- or kid-safe.  Pepper is ready for retirement after several years as
a brood mom.  She enjoys creature comforts, including the couch. She has improved her leash manners; vaccinated and
dewormed, spayed and dental complete.  Ready for her forever home & so deserving!
