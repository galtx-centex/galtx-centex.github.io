This beautiful brindle and white lady has big brown eyes that can melt anyone's heart!  Lily was quite a successful
racer--she ran in over 100 official races, winning 17.  Not small child, cat or small dog friendly: Lily is a confident
gal who gives kisses to almost everyone she meets.  She would most enjoy a home in which she has a regular routine,
quiet time and socialization.  Great on leash, "Tiger Lily" is wonderfully behaved on patios and likes perusing with
human companions in outdoor shopping centers, home improvement stores and farmers markets.  Six years young, Lily is an
active gal and enjoys hiking, running and playing in the dog park with large dogs.  Lily needs consistent leadership to
maximize her charming qualities. She would be best suited in a home with access to a yard via dog door. May need crating
initially, especially with another dog in household, but possibly not needed after adjustment phase.
