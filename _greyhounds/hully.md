Hully is a lover. He gives kisses and nibbles and loves to be petted and brushed. He wants to be with you at all times.
He wants to share your bed (indulgent fosters!) and sleeps with his legs in the air. He will sleep until the alarm rings
but once you are up he is ready to go. He is great on a leash. Hully still has some puppy in him and, like all younger
dogs, needs repetition in training. He is learning not to counter surf and that baseball hats are not for chewing.
