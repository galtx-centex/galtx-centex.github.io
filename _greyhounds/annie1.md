Annie (Cry Antigua) had quite a successful racing career, at one point winning 13 races in a row!  At age nine, she is still playful and active. She enjoys a good long walk, or a zoomie in the yard.  
Annie was previously adopted, but was returned due to a family change, and no fault of her own.  She knows all about good house manners. Annie is more vocal than other greyhounds, so not the best match for an apartment dweller. She would prefer another dog companion. 
Annie is very loyal and loving, always nearby when watching TV or working at the computer.  She is also a great car rider, and will gladly join you on any adventure. 
Annie does have a chronic eye condition which is managed with eye drops/ ointment.
