Just like his namesake, MacGyver is quite the character! "Mac" is a happy-go-lucky seven year old male whose presence is instantly noticeable. From the moment he walked into his foster home, he made it his mission to follow everyone everywhere -- the ultimate velcro dog. As soon as you open a door he's on the other side of, his nose instantly pops in. He's been waiting! And he's so excited to see you! Honestly, where have you been? While he is animated at home with his constantly wagging tail and daily roaching, he is reserved and calm in public spaces. He absolutely loves going on walks, does well on a leash, and is enthusiastic about meal times. 

MacGyver raced domestically in Florida and West Virginia before serving as a blood donor in California. He recently came to GALT due to unforeseen changes in his owners' living situation. Because he has lived in a home already, his house manners are impeccable (occasionally eyeing his foster brother's food notwithstanding). He doesn't get up on furniture, respects boundaries, and jumps up into the truck for adventures with ease. While he coexists with his foster brother just fine, Mac is an independent spirit and would also do well as an only dog. Due to his size, lack of awareness about his size, and energy, Mac would probably be best suited to a house with older kids. He is such a good and happy boy with a lot of love to give. Rumor has it that he can't wait to meet you and follow you around forever!
