Ranger is a kind boy looking for a forever home with someone that will love him as much as he loves them! Ideally he would adore someone who is calm and patient, and has another pup to chase around the yard.  After his 10 minutes of morning zoomie time, he just wants to laze around the house with you, receive lots of pets, or maybe go for a quiet walk. Ranger is quite intuitive at reading the energy in a room. Because he is a sensitive soul, he does take a minute to really warm up to you.  When you have such a big heart, you have to be careful with it! Ranger loves his person so much that he gets a little mournful when they leave, and may initially let the world know about it with his laments.  He thrives on routine though, so we feel confident he will leave this behavior behind with time and stability.  Of course, if his people were home a lot, all the better.
Ranger likes chew bones and treats, but hasn't yet figured out what toys are all about. He is house trained and crate trained, friendly with other  pups, and has never shown any destructive habits. 
Ranger had orthopedic surgery on May 5, 2020 and has been such a champ about it. He has been using his down time to milk some extra love and attention from his doting foster mom.
