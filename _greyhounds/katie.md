Katie is a fun, fabulous girl who enjoys car rides, walks, running and playing in the yard. We think she could make a great agility dog, as her foster family describes her as bold, adventurous and energetic. She would really enjoy an equally playful dog friend (but no littles please!) Her house manners are excellent.

Katie would not be a good fit for a family with young children. She exhibits some sleep startle and space aggression, and her style of play can be quite exuberant. Katie has the elegant look you expect of a greyhound, but with a high octane personality. Katie responds really well to training and likes to please.
