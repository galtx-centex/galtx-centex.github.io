Sheila is a petite, pretty, velvety soft, and light brindle colored female. She is a little shy at first but warms up
quickly to affection and praise (and treats)! She loves being brushed. She hops up with her front feet off the ground
when her foster parents come home, even if it was just a quick trip to the corner store. Sheila was not only quick on
the race track, but she is also a quick study and smart. She is good on a leash, sleeps through the night, and has great
house-training manners. This sweet girl might be small dog friendly and cat-workable, but her foster family is still
working with her to determine that for sure. She would benefit from a home with a dog companion (due to her shyness) or
if you have plenty of time for her.
