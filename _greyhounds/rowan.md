Rowan is a big boy who, despite his size, is relatively calm and mild mannered.  He loves affection and being close to you.  If you squat down to his level, he’ll put his neck on your shoulder like a hug.  He does very well on a leash and is friendly to every dog he meets, big and small.  He loves walks and seeing the leash is the only time when he gets really energetic. He’s a needy guy and doesn’t like to be alone.  He isn’t currently crated and does well when left at home, provided he has another pet friend to keep him company.  

Small kids who are loud and move erratically make him anxious, but he loves receiving affection from older kids who understand how to approach him calmly.  His biggest quirk is that he doesn’t like anyone sitting next to him when he is laying down.  He will growl, but it has never been anything but talk.  He will always get up and move to another location.  He doesn’t mind scratches and love when he’s laying down, he just doesn’t want you to sit down.  We’ve found that giving him his own smaller space that no one else can share with him has made him feel most comfortable.

Chair not included ;)
