I'm a gentle gentleman named Waco. I was found as a stray in the Waco, Texas area a couple of months ago, and adapted quickly to home life in my foster home. I'm living with small dogs and cats, and we are one big happy family. Iâ€™m ready to meet my forever family!

**Update:**

Thanks to a generous grant from [The Petfinder Foundation](http://www.petfinderfoundation.com/), Waco will receive a plush orthopedic bed and a one year supply of Heartworm prevention with his adoption!
