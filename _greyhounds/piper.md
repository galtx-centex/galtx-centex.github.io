Piper is all puppy...she likes to play and chew on things. She is very loving and gets along with other dogs very well.
She would definitely prefer not to be on a leash, but does OK. Is house trained, but has a few accidents every now and
again (living in a house instead of a crate IS quite confusing sometimes). She likes to cuddle, prefers to sleep on the
bed with foster dad, but does fine when crated. Piper is very close to her foster dad, so will need extra comfort during
her adjustment period away from him. Piper is a wonderful young greyhound that will make someone very happy.
