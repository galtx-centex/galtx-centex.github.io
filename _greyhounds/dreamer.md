Dreamer had a short racing career in Limerick, Ireland. He is a smaller boy at only 60 lbs.  Currently enjoying the company of a similar sized poodle, he enjoys his leash walks in the neighborhood, and has been perfect on house training.  This lad really is a dream - unless you are a cat.  Then he would be a nightmare. 


Our adoption fee for Irish Greyhounds is currently $750, due to the transportation expense.
