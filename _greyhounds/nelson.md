Nelson is the definition of a gentle giant at a lanky 75lbs. He's a little shy and is still learning people are
awesome. However - when you're not looking, you may get sniper kissed or end
up with a big Nelson head on your chest for neck and ear scratches. He's got the potential to be a great
snuggler and will usually crawl closer to you if you sit near his bed for maximum petting opportunity.
He's just figured out toys and seems to prefer crinkly toys to squeakers. He eats well from his bowl at
his designated spot in the kitchen for breakfast and dinner and doesn't seem to mind if the other dogs
investigate his bowl when mealtimes are done. On walks, he doesn't pull on the leash and tends to
stick close to his human. He would probably benefit being in a home with another dog when his humans
are gone because he does tend to follow their lead.
