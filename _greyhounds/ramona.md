Ramona is a good girl who likes to pass her days lying in her crate or somewhere she can see what you're doing. She is somewhat of a 'velcro-dog' and is happiest when she knows where you are and can be near you. She is very curious about everything, especially if you are making something in the kitchen! Mealtime is her favorite time of day - she loves food and is always looking for more - and this is also when she displays the most energy. Ramona is always happy to get more pets and scritches. She walks well on a leash, even next to busy streets. She's not the fastest, but she's happy to walk up to about 45 minutes at a time. Ramona definitely prefers the company of people to that of other dogs. Whenever she sees another dog, she becomes very timid and either 'freezes' or tries to walk away from them, but she hasn't displayed signs of aggression, and this has been true for all breeds she has encountered. She will occasionally get excited when she sees a squirrel in motion and try to run after it, but her interest never lasts for very long. Ramona has not been exposed to children or other household pets. One accomplishment Ramona is proud of, is her ability to go up and down stairs with relative ease! After an initial period of reluctance, she has gotten the hang of it and now goes up and down open-backed stairs like a pro. She is crate trained and happy to spread out there after a long day of not-too-much activity.
