Tall, dark and handsome Ernie is a real character. Make eye contact with him, and he is right in your face trying to get to first base! He is famous for his little "butt scratch" dance when you find just the right spot. 

Ernie is an active boy who would like to find a similarly adventurous family with a yard.
