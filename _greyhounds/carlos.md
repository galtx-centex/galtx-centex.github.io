Carlos is a happy guy, so happy you've got to watch out for that tail sometimes! Retiring from the track, he has quickly
made himself at home inside his foster house. He loves lounging on big fluffy dog beds while chewing a fluffy squeaker
toy. He does well on a leash and enjoys playing and running with the resident greyhound when outside.
