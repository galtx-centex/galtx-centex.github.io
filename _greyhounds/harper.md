Hi, I’m Harper. I’m a young, single female with a trim figure and lots of energy, looking for a long term relationship. I love long walks, cuddling, stuffed toys, car rides and being with that special person. I really like to keep busy with an assortment of activities (including collecting blankets, stuffed toys, and gardening). During the day I like to nap close by while you work in your home office, but be warned… I snort in my sleep. If you leave the house, I like to be crated, in fact, it’s the safest place for me because I like to snoop when you aren’t home. I am currently staying with a foster mom with a teenage boy, two greyhounds and three cats. It’s a little crowded, but I get along with everyone just fine, especially if I don’t have to share the stuffed toys. If you are interested, leave a message with my service.
