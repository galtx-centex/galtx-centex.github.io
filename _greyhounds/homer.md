I'm a handsome and well behaved gentleman of a greyhound who is enjoying my new retirement.
I'm 7 years old and ran an impressive 144 races in my day. Now I'm a calm and well-behaved
member of my foster family's home. They say that I fell into their routine right away and get
along well with the 5 small dogs in my house (meaning I completely ignore them). I'm curious
and interested in the world around me and I love to sit in my favorite spot by the window and
gaze outside. I'm quite adaptable, and currently looking forward to meeting my forever people
when the time is right.
