It has been a real pleasure getting to know Malia. What a champ she is! At eleven years old, her life as she knew it was completely changed. She has taken to her new surroundings with grace. 

Malia lost all her teeth when she came into our program, but quickly bounced back from a lengthy, painful procedure.  She has never missed a meal, though she frequently exhibits "escaped tongue syndrome" 😛 On a positive note, she will never need another dental!

Malia walks well on leash; she is affectionate though not clingy. She can climb stairs that are inside, solid and carpeted. She is a smaller girl at about 60 lbs. 

Give this sweet senior a try.
