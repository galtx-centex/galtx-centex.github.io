Ahava is a social butterfly who loves to give and receive affection. She makes friends wherever she goes and enjoys meeting new people.  She always gets compliments on her soft fur and sweet temperament. Ahava also enjoys hanging around and playing with other dogs.  She is good about sharing toys and treats.  
Ahava is an eager eater, but not food or space aggressive.  She is completely house trained and (mostly) chews only on her toys.  She may need to be reminded about not begging at the table or counter surfing, but she is a smart girl that repsonds to gentle corrections.
Ahava has an old, racing injury that causes her to hop sometimes, but it doesn't stop her from enjoying a walk around the neighborhood or playing in the yard.  She does well on leash, never pulls.  After a short walk, she is content to sprawl out and doze, or find a person for some cuddles. 
Ahava had an impressive racing career under the name Hi Noon Passion.
