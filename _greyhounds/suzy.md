Are you patient?  I'm patient.  I take my time with everything.
I like to check things out before I decide if they're OK.
People say I'm shy, but really I'm just observing to figure things out first.
After I get to know them, people are great.
They scratch all the places I can't reach and take me on sidewalk adventures!
And they give me treats for going potty outside, and treats for approaching those slippery stairs, and treats with medicine inside.
They think I don't know there's medicine in there, but really cheese is just sooo yummy!
I like to play with Mr.  Duck - he squeaks when we wrestle.
I want to play with my cat roommates, but they don't understand dog-speak, so I just let them be.
I learn really fast - my foster parents are super impressed with how smart I am.
I'm still looking for my perfect, patient, permanent parents, but I know I'll see them soon.
Why do you think I'm so observant?
