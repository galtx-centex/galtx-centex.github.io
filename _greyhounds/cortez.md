I'm a very spunky and affectionate 7 year old female greyhound. I'm very easy going and just want to be right next to my people getting an ear scratch. I will walk right up to any new person that I meet to say hello. I love soft dog beds, squeaky toys, snuggling, and seeing new things. I'd love a home that's relaxing with someone who wants to explore the world with me.
