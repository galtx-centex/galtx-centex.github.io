A tall, confident and handsome 70 lb. red fawn fellow who learned how the greytest hugs in less than a week in foster
care! Loving and smart, Alfie "hugs" by wrapping himself around your legs. He has a healthy appetite, gets along with
dogs both large and small, but not cat-friendly; he would do well in a household either as the only dog or as one of a
group of dogs.
