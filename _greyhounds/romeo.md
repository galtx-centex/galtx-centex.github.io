There's a reason this boy is named Romeo -- he is a total lover!  This boy has just turned 4, and is just delightful.  He has never met a stranger and gets along fantastically with everyone -- kids, dogs of all sizes, and adults, including the elderly.  He is insanely sweet and loves to put his head in your lap and keep you company wherever you are.  He loves to go on walks and is playful -- with people and dogs.  He has an uncanny ability to hear you say his name from anywhere and will come running to see if you need anything.  While he would love to sit on the sofa with you or sleep in the bed with you, he also knows to sleep on his own bed.  Arrange to meet him, because he's just fantastic -- seriously the most loving and sweetest of boys!
