Stormy Ghadimi raced under the name "I Beg to Differ."  She was mother to 35 registered offspring including GPA-CT alumni: Bruiser, Zia, Rio and Alex.  She was a happy girl who enjoyed meeting people and represented her breed well at GPA-CT events.  Stormy enjoyed her life to the fullest - right up to the end.  She surprised her doctors by dislocating a toe while running in the backyard, despite her cancer diagnosis.  We miss her sweet spirit.
