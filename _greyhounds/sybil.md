Hi, my name is Sybil!  You may call me _amiable_, as I have a warm and friendly manner.  You
could also call me _capable_ since I am quick to master new things.  My foster mom says I am
_adorable_ (well yeah, I am a greyhound.)

Are you looking for a _comfortable_, _companionable_ dog like me?  Just donâ€™t call me late to my _kibble_!
