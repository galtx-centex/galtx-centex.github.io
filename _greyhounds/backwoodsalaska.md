Backwoods Alaska is mellow 12 month old 70 lb. male who retired early due to lack of interest in chasing the lure.
White with a dark brindle "beret" on his head, Alaska is a handsome and mellow fellow who loves to carry around stuffed
animals in his foster home.  His foster family reports:  Alaska is still doing great. Not nearly as shy as his first
day, house broken, small dog safe and very patient with children. Does not tear up toys, just carries them around.
Likely cat safe.  His appetite is great, and he likes to rest in his crate. Alaska may need sunscreen or limited outdoor
time in bright sun to protect his pink skin under that beautiful white coat.
