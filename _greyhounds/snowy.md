Snowy and his friend Elsa were brought into The Austin Animal Center in deplorable condition.  Emaciated, anemic, and full of parasites, he could barely take a few steps before needing to be carried.  

With the basics of hydration, nutrition, hygiene, and a kind hand, these dogs have shown remarkable spirit.

Snowy has an adorable smile and has begun wagging his tail in appreciation of his emergency foster family.  He has learned to follow the routine, and is comforted by having other hounds around him.  He is gaining weight steadily.

The treatment to restore these dogs back to health will be expensive and require months of care.  If you would like to help with a donation for Snowy’s care, please click the “Sponsor Me” button below.
