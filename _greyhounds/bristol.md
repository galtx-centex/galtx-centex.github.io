I am a sweet, affectionate brindle girl with BIG brown eyes. I love getting attention and am
happy to give some back to you. I enjoy going for walks, meeting people and discovering new
things. Playing with these new things called “toys” is quickly becoming one of my favorite
activities. I will even chase a tennis ball, throw it into the air and catch it on the way
down. Did I say "I LOOOVE people".

I am looking for a forever home with a soft spot for me to lay down and a few toys so I can
play, where I can live out my retirement. I will be your BEST friend and companion and follow
you wherever you go.
