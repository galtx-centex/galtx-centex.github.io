This handsome boy is just as sweet and as chill as can be.  He integrated perfectly into his foster family with no problems at all.  He gets along great with kids and other dogs -- large and small.  

He absolutely loves to be loved on, loves lounging on a comfy bed, and has shown no interest in getting on furniture. He loves going on walks and is a dream on the leash and stays by your side.  He's just a bit, sweet, lover of a boy who is beyond thrilled to just be able to hang out with you.

He also loves hanging out in the backyard, but because he wants to be with you will stand at the door to come back in to be with you once he's done his business. He sleeps very well on his own bed in your room, and stays in place all night.  

He is not shy or timid, and will follow you from room to room so that he can be with you and not miss out on any love opportunities, but he's also not pushy about it; He just can't wait to meet his forever family!
