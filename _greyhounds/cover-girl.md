Coco has the potential for becoming a special person's velcro hound. Her ideal forever home would be a somewhat quiet environment with a dog about her age and size, and a patient mom. She is very noise sensitive and fearful of strangers. Coco is a work in progress, but is thriving on the structured routine in her current foster home. When Coco first arrived, she would frequently skip meals if there was a noise or unexpected activity nearby. Now she expects breakfast promptly at 7:30 am. If foster mom is slow to rise, Coco will put her paws on the mattress edge pouncing. Likewise, Coco expects supper promplty at 4:30 pm and cleans her bowl everytime.

Coco enjoys Beggin' Strips as a special treat, stuffed toys and toys made of old socks. She mostly likes to lounge in her soft bed or follow foster mom around the house. Coco, with the help of her dedicated foster mom, is working on leash walking and general socialization and confidence building.
