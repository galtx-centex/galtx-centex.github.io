At nearly two years old, Linda packed her bags and left the racetrack realizing she would be happier in a good home.
Showing the energy and playfulness of a two-year-old, she loves toys and will likely do well in a home with responsible
kids and active adults to help keep her busy. She has done well with children in her foster home and is taking well to
leash training. She tends to be a little dominant and wants to be the center of attention among other dogs. She would do
well with a family that will be firm with her and other dogs who will not want to compete with her. She is friendly with
cats and other small animals. Available NOW!
