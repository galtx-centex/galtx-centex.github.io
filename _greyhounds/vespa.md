Vespa is a very spirited youngster. He loves to run, play chase and mouth-wrestle with the other hounds. Heâ€™s also quite mischievous. He steals things, all kinds of things, so nothing is off limits to his inquisitive curiosity. At only a year old, he is really just a puppy, doing puppy things.  This is good discipline for his human to keep things put up and waste baskets emptied.  This jet black dog is like a stealthy ninja!

Vespa is very loving and affectionate; he loves to cuddle. He enjoys tossing around his stuffed squeaky toys, too. His shiny black coat glints in the sun as he zooms around the yard and is just a pleasure to see.

Although Vespa never made it to the track, he does have a competitive nature when it comes to food and affection. He will not hesitate to push to the front of the line. He can also be a bit territorial of his space on the bed or sofa.  These behaviors are  not at all unusual in racing greyhounds, but should be monitored and not encouraged.  Also, Vespa is not fond of car rides.

Overall, Vespa is a sweet, lovable boy who appreciates a good time.  Like the scooter he was named after - fast and fun!
