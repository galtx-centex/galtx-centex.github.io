Y’all, Lucille is awesome! Her favorite things are cuddles and coddles, pets and pats, squirrel watching, peanut butter kongs, and all other TOYS! You should put all books and shoes that you care about in a closet because she generally knows what is a toy and what isn’t, but these things are confusing sometimes! Her least favorite things are loud trucks and slippery floors. Lucille is house trained without a single incident at her foster home, if you take her out and give her a patch of grass she’ll do her business right away. She stays quietly in her crate when needed, although she gets a little bored after a while and rumples the bed. She goes in her crate on her own if someone is in that room, but otherwise prefers to hang out with others. Lucille is super chill and friendly with medium to large dogs, but considering her intense interest in squirrels and other small animals at the vet she will do best in a home with only bigger companions. Lucille’s foster family have not seen her around young children yet.
