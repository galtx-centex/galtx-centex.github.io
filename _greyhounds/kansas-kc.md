I want to be your best friend!
Kansas could have been named "Shadow" as he will follow you around all day. He is beginning to learn some important words, like "wait" and "cookie". Not appropriate for cats or small dogs, KC is a ltitle anxious and would enjoy the company of another Greyhound. He loves to squeeze on his squeaky toys, but does not eviscerate them. Let's show KC some TX hospitality!
