You may know me as Kansas, but my foster family calls me Oddie, or dozens of silly variations on that. You see, I am NGA registered under the name "Odd Gray" and I am rather proud of my 96 career races.  

I currently live with a lovely foster mom and dad, three kiddos, and two Greyhound foster bros. I LOVE people and want to be with them ALL the time.  I have been through a lot of changes these last few months, and am a bit nervous about losing another home and family. If you are lonely, I promise to be your loyal sidekick, your ride or die, your BFF. In fact, I'm sure I could be your lap dog if you like. 

A few other tidbits about me: I have a beautiful singing voice - if you have fussy neighbors, they might not appreciate my serenades. I enjoy walks, and am very curious about my surroundings. In fact, too curious to safely live with small pets.  I have come to appreciate the softer side of life that comes with retirement - fuzzy blankets, pillows, stuffed toys, the squishier the better IMO. I am never destructive though.

Love and Licks, Oddie Gray
