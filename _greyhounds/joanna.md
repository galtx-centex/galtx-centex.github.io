Joanna is a black beauty who always gets compliments.  People want to meet her to feel her soft, shiny fur, and she’s all for it!  She gently approaches people in order to get a well-deserved pat or scratch.  Inside, she is calm and laid back.  She is easily trained if food is involved.  She is very smart, earning A’s for leash etiquette, and potty training in record time, and is always on the lookout for new things to learn. Unfortunately, due to the Covid19 quarantine, she has not been able to go to the dog park and find out how well she gets along with small animals and children.  Stay tuned for that info as soon as this hibernation is over.
