Molly is a retired racer and brood mama from Ireland! In her short time with us, she has discovered that a pool is the best way to survive a Texas Summer. Molly loves to snuggle up with a toy (or two or three). She does a couple quick yard zoomies throughout the day, but otherwise, is content on napping. 

Molly is a larger gal at over seventy lbs. with striking "cow dog" coloring. 

Our adoption fee for Irish Greyhounds is currently $750, due to the extra transportation expense.
