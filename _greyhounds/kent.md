Kent can be a bit of a "Nutter Butter" according to his fosters. He is mostly sweet, but a little salty at times, and he goes NUTS for any food or treats! 

Kent enjoys the company of the two female greyhounds in the home, but is not overly dependent on them. He likes attention, and with his stunning good looks, he gets a lot of it. He is learning not to counter-surf. Puppy-proofing will be important as he tends to swallow things he shouldn't ðŸ™„ Kent is house-trained, good on leash, and not very vocal. At this time, Kent will not be placed with young children, as he is still learning about personal space. 

This handsome hound is like Clark Kent. We think he has more to reveal with time and trust.
