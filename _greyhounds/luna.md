This sweet little princess will surely prance right into your heart.  Luna is a tattooed young greyhound that came to
our group via Austin Animal Center.  She is sooo sweet and affectionate, eager for attention from any person, even those
funny small ones.  Though it seems like she hasn't been in a house before, she is a quick learner. She absolutely loves
belly rubs, all kinds of toys, running and playing with the resident grey, and is learning to walk on a leash.
