Dovey is incredibly sweet and loves people. She gives kisses and has done great with the school-aged children in her foster family. She has adjusted quickly to home life and gets along great with the resident greyhound. She doesn't love going in her crate, but once there, she is content throughout the night. Due to Covid, she hasn't really been tested at being home alone. Dovey is house-trained and has learned to use a doggie door. 

Dovey is very much a puppy still - extremely curious, and excitable. She needs correction to not jump up and not mouth things. She will be a great fit for a family that is willing to invest a little time and energy. You will be greatly rewarded with unbridled affection.
