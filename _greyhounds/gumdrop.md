Hello, my name is Gumdrop and I'm a sweet 1 1/2 yrs old. I'm new to this house life. I'm still a little unsure about inside. The hard floors are tricky but I have learned to use the rugs my foster family has put down for traction. I'm learning about toys, soft beds, food, treats, food, stairs, and oh yeah food so you better watch your plates! I follow my foster family around and watch my foster brother and sister. I'm still figuring this all out including something called housebreaking and learning to tell them when I want to go outside. More to follow as I learn more everyday.
