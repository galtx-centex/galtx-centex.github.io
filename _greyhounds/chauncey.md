Our golden boy Chauncey never made it to the racetrack. He is a young, happy scamp. 
Chauncey is super with kids and enjoys their attention. He likes to play a game of stealing your personal items (things with your scent, like socks and underwear).

Chauncey is still learning about suburban life and will startle at strange noises on walks, but he is doing better every day. He will be a fun addition to your family!
