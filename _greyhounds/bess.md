Bess is the besst! This soft, gentle little cutie is one of our favorite fosters ever! She is so sweet, and gets along great with everyone (may work with a calm, confident cat). 
She does not need a crate; her house manners are perfect. Zero accidents, no chewing, no jumping on counters, furniture, or people!
She loves going for walks, and walks politely on a loose leash.
Bess is ready to go home to her lucky adopter!
