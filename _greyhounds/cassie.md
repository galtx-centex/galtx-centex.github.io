Cassie is a silly and sweet girl with puppy-like energy and curiosity. She LOVES her collection of soft toys. Cassie enjoys her trips to the dog park where she gets along with other large dogs. She is working on her leash manners (those darn deer and squirrels are so distracting). Stairs are an easy hop, skip and jump, also this girl can sit!  Mostly, Cassie loves people and will never be far from you. She accepts being crated when her foster family is away. 

Cassie has a winning personality and her sleek black coat is a real show stopper. Be prepared for a lot of attention if you adopt this girl!
