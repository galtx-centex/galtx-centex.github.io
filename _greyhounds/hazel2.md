Lovely little Hazel is all about the play!  She will do best in a home with other playful dogs to burn up some of her puppy energy.  She has gotten along with all breeds of dogs so far, both large and small.  At the end of a busy day, she is also an excellent cuddle buddy.  

Hazel and her brother Bruce came from an unregistered litter, here in Texas.  We believe she may be Greyhound/ Whippet mix.  Currently 50 lbs., though she will probably fill out some more.
