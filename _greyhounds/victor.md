I'm Victor, a 4 year old beautiful red brindle greyhound. I have an outgoing and friendly personality and just love to explore and meet new people. I have 3 greyhound foster sisters and have adapted quickly to their routine and life in a home. I get attention wherever I go for my beautiful eyes and coat. I can't wait for my happily ever after!
