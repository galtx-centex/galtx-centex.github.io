This eight-year-old former brood mama had a successful racing career. She is a golden gal, calm, sweet, unimposing and
just wants a quiet place to rest and regular meals. She is healthy and energetic enough for good paced walks up to a
couple miles. She has a loving personality, particularly toward men. She prefers not to be disturbed when resting, and
would flourish in a home with access to a dog door or frequent short walks and potty breaks.
