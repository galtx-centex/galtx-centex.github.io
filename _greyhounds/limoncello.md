What could be better than a cool, sweet Limoncello after dinner?  Limoncello's foster family says he will be a
wonderful pet for someone.   Housebroken, Limoncello leaves the cats alone, appears to be cat safe, and gets along well
with the 9 month old resident puppy. Working on his confidence, Limoncello is fairly timid and feels safe in his crate
even with an open door.  Recovering from a small race injury (side cut), the vet says Limoncello's sutures will help him
heal without scarring; he is very good about taking his pills along with his food.  A true follower, Limoncello is cool,
sweet and easy-going, content to let another dog get in front of him on walks. He's not very food motivated but is more
willing to try things if he sees the resident dog demonstrate first.
