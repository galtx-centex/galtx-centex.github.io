Sandy is a sweet boy that loves when his humans visit him for cuddles and pets. He does not approach for attention, nor get on the bed or couch, so far. Sandy is a homebody who loves the yard and someone to play with; he is not a fan of car rides. 

Sandy was shy initially, but has now found his voice. He will let you know when he needs to go out, or tell you when there is someone at the door, or simply that he's bored :D Once comfortable in a place, he will do little playful jumps and nibbles. Sandy is crate trained and will nap most of the day while his people are at work.
