Hopper gets along well with small dogs and cats.  We have had her with our grandchildren, ages 1 & 2, and she was wonderfully tolerant of them.  She is easy to walk, and not too fearful of things. We have had her 4 weeks and no accidents in the house.   We did catch her nibbling on a phone charging cable and jumping up on the kitchen counter top after food, but these are correctable issues.   She's just very sweet and will make a great family dog!
