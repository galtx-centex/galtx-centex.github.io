Bronco is the definition of a gentle giant! He loves chilling around the house with his person and is a curious and a quick learner. He learned the stairs after going up them only twice. He gets along great with other pups, although he isn't so sure about those rambunctious kiddos. They're okay when they're calm, but they sure do get loud and rowdy, and that makes him want to go lay in a quiet corner. He has not been around small dogs or cats in his foster home, but he did not pass his cat-safe test with GALT. Bronco has adjusted so well to a home and is crate trained, although he gets mournful when he is left home alone. He has almost completely figured out this potty training thing too! He loves stuffed animals and toys, especially chasing a lure pole. He likes basking in the sun and walks great on a leash for short walks. He is an absolute love bug for pets, constantly approaching for head scratches. He gets so excited when his person gets home and wants to give kisses! He even chatters his teeth in excitement when he is happy, or when he is getting some good scritches. While he does well with other dogs, he does not seem overly dependent on them and could possibly do well as an only dog too. He can be shy with people at first but he warms up quickly and bonds strongly. He is a tender soul that only needs gentle redirection to get a point across. Overall, he is just a smart and loving boy that would thrive in calm home with gentle and patient people!
