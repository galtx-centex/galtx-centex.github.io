A dainty, elegant lady, Jeanine is a svelte black and white tuxedo gal; just add pearls and she's ready for an evening
stroll to your favorite dog-friendly restaurant.  A little timid at first, "Jeanie" warms up once she gets to know
you. She is currently fostered with an outgoing female greyhound and is growing more confident by the day. She enjoys
walks, and instinctively takes the heel position--naturally perfect on leash. Jeanie may be the lady for you!
