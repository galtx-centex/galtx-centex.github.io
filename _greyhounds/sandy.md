Sandy came to us as a stray from the San Marcos Animal Shelter. She is very timid and shy. Sandy was a brood mama during
her earlier years, and we suspect that she was abused in some way due to her sensitive nature. GPA Central Texas is
investing in special emotional and behavioral mentoring to help bring out the personality of this special girl.
Originally thought to be Greyhound/Saluki mix, we think she is all Saluki and is simply stunning. Sandy needs a gentle
home and a gentle heart to care for her and show her how wonderful being a pet can be.
