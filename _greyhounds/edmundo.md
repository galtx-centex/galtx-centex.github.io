My name is Ed and I sometimes go by Mr. Ed, although I cannot talk. I am an inquisitive boy with
the heart of a teddy bear. I love getting attention and following my foster family into every
room in the house. Yes, I love houses and what a difference from my farm.

My racing career took off once I turned of age and ended after 98 races. Now, I am retired and
want to play with my people every chance I get. I was recently introduced to this thing called
a doggie door. This is the best thing since ground meat, well maybe not ground meat. I can go
outside anytime I want and take care of my business and bark at the deer :-)

I'm looking for a family that wants to teach me new things, take me on walks and pets me until
their hands fall off. Come see me, I am very handsome.
