A 4 1/2 year old cat-possible former racer with striking good looks, Black and White ticked Chrissy has just retired
after running 123 races (winning 18). Outgoing, sociable, and always wagging her tail, Chrissy is adjusting to
retirement like an absolute pro: totally synced into her foster family in only two days. Cat-possible, she has not shown
interest in the cat while still, but finalized cat-testing still pending. She does crate well since she is used to being
crated from racing life, but is not currently crated in her foster home. Chrissy is a LOVELY girl, mellow and so very
affectionate, very submissive and thrives under her foster hound brother's guidance. This social butterfly would like a
home with another hound and in which she can go out to meet new people often and show them the wonder of greyhounds!
