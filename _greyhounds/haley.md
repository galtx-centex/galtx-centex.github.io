Meet new foster greyhound Haley, a 60 lb. sweet, velvety soft 7 year old red-fawn female with smoky ears and tail.
Haley was a successful racer who had a few puppies following her laps around the racetrack. She's crate-trained,
cat-possible, and enjoys a little tuna atop her kibble meals. Haley is little reserved at first, but warms up quickly
to kind hands. Haley is fostered in a home with another female greyhound and gets along well with other submissive
dogs, and could comfortably be an only dog to soak up all the attention and love from her adopters. Haley is looking
for a dignified forever home with no children or older, respectful children--who can resist those heart-melting big
brown eyes?
