Olive is a petite, eight year old female searching for a loyal companion. Olive enjoys her regular walks through the neighborhood where she has become quite the dignatary. Her other pastimes include sunbathing in the yard and tossing around her stuffies.

We believe Olive will do best as an only dog. She can be a bit of a bossy pants and likes to play rough.  Olive can be very lovey and cuddly; she has a soft bunny-like coat. She much prefers her human's bed or couch to any dog bed. She loves attention, and can be vocal about getting it. If you have what it takes to keep this princess content, we would love to hear from you. Olive deserves to have her "happily ever after" ending.
