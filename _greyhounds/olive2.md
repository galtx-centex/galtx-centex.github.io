Olive is a petite, eight year old female searching for a loyal companion. She loves attention, and can be quite vocal about getting it. She much prefers her human's bed or couch to any dog bed. Olive has a soft "bunny" coat which will require some brushing (despite what the Greyhound books say.) When the temps are less than deadly, she does enjoy sunbathing in the yard. She likes a short morning and evening walk, though she gets easily distracted by all the sights and smells. Toys are great fun, too. 

We believe Olive will do best as an only dog. She can be a bit of a bossy pants and likes to play rough. Olive can be very lovey and cuddly, but this diva dog wants it on her terms! If you have what it takes to keep this princess content, we would love to hear from you. Olive deserves to have her "happily ever after" ending.
