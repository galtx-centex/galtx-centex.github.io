Olive enjoys her regular walks through the neighborhood where she has become quite the dignatary. Her other pastimes include sunbathing in the yard and tossing around her stuffies.

We believe Olive's needs are best met as a permanent foster. She is doing wonderfully with her dedicated foster family, but due to some health concerns, we don't want to move her anymore. Olive and her foster will always have the support of GALT Central Texas behind them.
