Horus is an active  1 1/2 year old neutered male, about 70 lbs, with a stunning red coat. He is better known as Grant (get it? Foster Grant) or G-man by his foster family.  He is described as funny and loving.  One of his endearing quirks, when being petted, he will roll over on his back for a tummmy rub.  He will let you know with three little yips, if you aren't done yet!
Grant gets along well with the two smaller dogs in his foster home. He is accustomed to a large fenced yard where they all play tag daily. Grant was recently proven cat friendly, too.  He loves his stuffy toys, and does well on car rides.
Grant is working on his leash manners and crate training.  Also, he should be allowed appropriate chew toys, while he grows out of his puppiness. He takes well to correction, and will make an excellent companion with a little bit of positive reinforcement.
