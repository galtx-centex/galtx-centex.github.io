Shhhh-don’t tell Besame she is nine years old.  This active girl loves to play and go on walks! She is a great girl. No housebreaking issues at all, sweet, outgoing, and loves everyone! She gets along great with our Greyhound, and doesn’t react to small dogs we see on walks. 
She does have a few quirks...sometimes she will freeze up on walks, but we are working with her and she’s getting better. She also wants to dash out the front door, so she must be watched when the door is open! 
She has beautiful thick, glossy fur, with amazingly little gray! 
After nearly 150 races, and two litters of puppies, this lively girl is loving her retirement!
