Howdy! My name is Kelly; I was born and raised right here in Texas. Not to brag, but the first thing you'll notice about me is my beauty. I have a soft fawn and white coat, with gorgeous eyes. My eyeliner is perfection. I get along well with the two resident Greyhounds in my foster home, but small pets activate my prey drive. I walk well on a loose leash until I encounter a lizard, or other interesting critter to chase. My foster family is working to curb this :( 
I dislike the crate, but I really don't need it, as I have perfect house manners. I am confident, sweet and smart. I love my people, and always want to be near them.
