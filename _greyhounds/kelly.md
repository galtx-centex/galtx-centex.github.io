Howdy! My name is Kelly; I was born and raised right here in Texas. Not to brag, but the first thing you'll notice about me is my beauty. I have a soft fawn and white coat, with gorgeous eyes. My eyeliner is perfection. I am confident, sweet and smart with perfect house manners. I love my people, and always want to be near them. I enjoy a vigorous walk in the morning and then will lounge around the house in true Greyhound fashion. Stuffed toys are fun to pounce on and play with on days when it's too hot outside.

Kelly would prefer a house without stairs and definitely without small pets.
