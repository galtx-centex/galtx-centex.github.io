Dino is a large staghound-type, who was rescued from the streets of Corpus Christi by a dedicated group of volunteers. He has recently completed Heartworm treatment, and is ready to meet his forever family. 

Things to know: stairs - no problem, thunderstorms - no problem, accepting treats gently - got that, crate trained, house trained - check, check. We feel Dino would do best with a quiet, predicatble routine. He still has "stranger danger"  from his days on the streets, and needs a champion in his corner, who can see his full potential.
