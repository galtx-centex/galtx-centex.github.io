Dino is a large staghound-type, who was rescued from the streets of Corpus Christi by a dedicated group of volunteers. He has recently completed Heartworm treatment, and is ready to meet his forever family.

Things to know: stairs - no problem, thunderstorms - no problem, accepting treats gently - got that, crate trained, house trained - check, check. We feel Dino would do best with a quiet, predictable routine. He still has "stranger danger"  from his days on the streets, and needs a patient adopter, who will continue to work with him building trust. 

 UPDATE: DNA testing revealed that Dino is equal parts Greyhound and Great Dane, with some other things mixed in, and just a dash of Borzoi. Truly a special guy!
