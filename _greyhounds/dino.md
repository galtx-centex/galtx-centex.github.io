Dino is a large staghound-type, who was rescued from the streets of Corpus Christi by a dedicated group of volunteers. Sadly, he does have Heartworms and some other medical issues that are being addressed. He is currently on medical hold while he rests and heals. We are unsure of his exact age, but he is a senior that will be looking for his final and forever family in the springtime.
