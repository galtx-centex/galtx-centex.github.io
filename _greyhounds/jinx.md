Jinx is a petite, young thing, looking for that special someone. She is registered with NGA, but never raced. 
Inside the home, Jinx loves to play with her toys and carries her little family of critters with her.  She will stay quietly in her crate overnight, and in the morning, she will shower you with affectionate kisses.  
The outside world is still a big and scary place for Jinx.  Her foster family is working with her, but it's baby steps.  Jinx really needs a patient, quiet household with a mentor dog.  She needs someone in her corner to be her champion.
