Twinkle's a one year old affectionate love bug, 44lbs of sweet energy coated in the softest white and brindle-ticked fur
you've ever petted. She feels as soft as a rabbit! Small-dog safe, cat testing pending...she does not like being crated
but is a bit of a counter surfer and is learning house manners.
