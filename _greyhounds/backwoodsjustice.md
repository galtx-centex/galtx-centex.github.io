18 months old, cat-curious red brindle with white chest and feet, dark muzzle: Justice is a diamond in the rough. A
cross between a toddler and a preteen, Justice is very smart, but also gets bored unless his energy can be drained
appropriately. He is definitely an active and inquisitive fellow, a good candidate for daily walks and an active
household. Justice is affectionate, outgoing, kid-friendly, and curious about everything. He loves to go to meet and
greets. Justice has been working through some separation anxiety, and is a good candidate for a patient person who can
help him mature, ideally someone who works from home or is home a lot and can patiently work with him. He loves to chew
bones and a Kong stuffed with peanut butter or cheese, and is learning that his crate is a safe haven. Justice would do
well in a household with an experienced adopter and at least one other canine companion who he can play with and learn
from.
