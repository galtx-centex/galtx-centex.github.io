Hazel is a sweet, lovable girl who loves to run and play followed by long naps.  Hazel is very confident around new people and isn't bothered by noise or new experiences.  Hazel was cat curious at first, but they negotiated an understanding pretty quickly, so she can tolerate a cat.  She is learning better leash manners.  She loves walks and is a bundle of energy who wants to go fast so she does pull right now (harness recommended).  Hazel doesn't like smaller dogs that make a lot of noise or are territorial although she does fine playing with larger dogs once introduced properly.  She is a confident, dominant personality with a hard head and a soft heart.  Hazel learned the house rules very quickly and hasn't had any accidents.  She loves scratches, snuggles, treats, and her people (she makes some noise when separated, but settles in after 5 minutes).  Hazel would be a great addition to any family!
