I am a very athletic and beautiful greyhound, at least that's what people tell me. :) I had a long racing career, racking up over 150 races and several puppy litters. In my retirement, I still enjoy running sprints in the backyard. I am the fastest among my 3 foster greyhound siblings! I also love to be around people, and have a happy and playful disposition. I receive many compliments on my beautiful white coat!

Sadly, Philly had been diagnosed with Cancer in her shoulder.  Surgery was not an option.  She remained a permanent resident in her foster home where she was attached and happy.  Philly was not in any pain and was still quite active.  She enjoyed her life for as long as possible, and is now in a better place.

Goodbye, Philly.
