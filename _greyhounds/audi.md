An 18 month old cat-curious male, white with black brindle ticking and a spot on his head, has a very good appetite and
enjoys a short walk every day.  He has learned how to signal that he needs to go out and has steadily improved with his
house training.  His foster said "he is still a puppy from time to time and managing that is fun."  Audi enjoys the Kong
stuffed with a treat, and is curious about a running cat, but submissive to the dominant cat.  Audi loves to go for car
rides and enjoys watching the road through the windshield.  He is crate trained and has good leash manners, and loves to
explore the yard.
