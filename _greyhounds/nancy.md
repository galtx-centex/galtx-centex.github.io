Fancy Nancy has a bit of a shopping addiction - some might call it a hoarding problem. She just loves to gather up toys and other misc. items, to carry them back to her bed. Nancy is a busy young lady who would enjoy someone to play fetch with. She excitedly greets all arriving family or visitors. Loves some good lovin' and gives her kisses freely.  

Nancy is food motivated, and will challenge you to keep your counter tops clean. Currently lives with a mixed pack of dogs, and is figuring out her place and her new environment. Nancy plays hard, loves hard, and then sleeps harder!
