Currently fostered with two female greyhounds, gorgeous Giselle is a 3-year-old "strawberry blond" who is ready for true
love and life as a pampered pet.  She had a rough start before arriving in the arms of GPA-CT volunteers as a shelter
release.  Giselle is a greytful spirit with a dainty face, and was smiling from the moment she was picked up. In her
former life, Giselle was inappropriately kept outdoors and sadly had not received basic vet care and TLC.  Our
volunteers and vet removed the ticks and fleas, trimmed her nails, and bathed her to reveal a beautiful, soft and thick
red fawn coat. Luckily, she tested heartworm negative and is at a good weight.  She is an easy-going, confident,
crate-trained gal with excellent leash manners, and is a very good car rider.  Giselle wants to be your companion on the
road-trip of life! Giselle comes out of her crate on her own, she seeks affection from her fosters, she LOVES playing
with squeaky toys and she will lay in the living room with her foster family when they watch TV. She has really come out
of her shell, and though is still a little skittish at times, she has made huge improvements.  She does not seem to be a
chaser of small dogs or squirrels during daily walks.  Cat-testing pending.
