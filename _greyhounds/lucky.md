Here is a fine Irish boy, four years old and just 55 lbs. His black coat has subtle "snowflake" flecks, a pattern we rarely see. Lucky lives in an active foster family with kids and cats. He can be quite vocal when confined to his crate, much preferring the comfort of the sofa. We believe Lucky will make a perfect pet for a special family. 

Our adoption fee for Irish Greyhounds is currently $750, due to the increased transportation costs.
