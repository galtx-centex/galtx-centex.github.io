Although Mona Nicole is an energetic two-year-old, she is also a dog who loves to stretch out on the couch with you on a
rainy, winter afternoon and help you watch the game. She is naturally affectionate and companionable. Although she
prefers the company of her human family, she gets along great with other dogs and will fit in readily with the pack. She
likes cats also, showing curiosity but no aggression. She has smarts, too, quickly learning not to repeat what has
gotten her in trouble before. Mona limps on her rear left leg and vets are uncertain if surgery will help. But it does
not hold her back at all, and after your first day with her, you will not notice it either.
