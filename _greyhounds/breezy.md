JIT Cool Breeze (Breezy) is easy-breezy. This 4-year-old white/brindle sweetheart is all love. He is always close-by
wherever you are in the house and just wants to please you. He is okay in a crate, but would prefer to have his own
space in your house. Although he is a larger male, he is sweet with children and probably small dogs. He will make a
wonderful addition to your family!
