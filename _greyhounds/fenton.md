Like Fenton Glassware, this boy is something beautiful and special. Fenton is the most affectionate hound we have met, freely giving hugs and kisses. He learned the doggie door within a day, and has been perfect on house training. His helicopter tail is quite comical. 

Our adoption fee for Irish Greyhounds is currently $750, due to the extra transportation expense.
