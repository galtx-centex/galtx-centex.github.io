Everyone loved Vicki.  She was the smart, sociable ambassadog at our Tomlinsonâ€™s Four Points
location.  Talk about social - she had an Instagram following of 1500 fans!  Most importantly,
she was a beloved member of the Troyer family where she enjoyed long hikes on the greenbelt and
teaching those greyhound foster boys how to behave.  Vicki and Kat Troyer were especially
close, having pretty much grown up together for the past seven years.   Hugs from your GPA
family.
