Carmelo is as sweet as a caramel & vanilla sundae.  He came to GPA as a stray from the San Marcos Animal Shelter.
Approximately 18 months old, he was most likely a brood stud from a breeder.  With a handsome long, wavy coat and wispy
fur on his ears and tail, Carmelo is a gorgeous male Saluki or Saluki-Greyhound mix.  Small in stature, Carmelo is only
40 lbs. and arrived underweight; he is being given a special diet to help him gain some weight and is under veterinary
monitoring before he will be ready for his forever home.  He is wonderful on leash, curious, seeks affection, and is
crate-trained; Carmelo will melt your heart! Prefers not to be crated, but can be crated if necessary. He gets along
with dogs both large and small and is kid safe, but probably not cat or other small animal safe. Carmelo would do best
in a household with another playmate dog to keep him company and share toys.
