Nova has real super star potential!  She is playful and cuddly, outspoken and brave. She crates well while foster mom is at work, though she would love if you invited her to share your sofa. Nova was found as a stray in West Texas; our vet estimates she is only one year old. Although full grown (55lbs.), she does have some puppy-like mischievous behavior that will require boundaries and redirection.  Time invested in her training will be rewarded with a stellar companion. She would do well with a physically active family and similarly playful dog. Probably not suited for cats or other small pets.
