I’m a spunky and curious 6 year old girl who loves to play! I have a very sweet personality and love attention from my humans. I’m always exploring my surroundings and playing with my toys. I love car rides and getting to go on walks! I am very curious and like to "collect" my toys. I get along great with my foster brother (a greyhound) and love to play with other breeds of big dogs. I hope to meet my forever family very soon!!

**Update:**

Thanks to a generous grant from [The Petfinder Foundation](http://www.petfinderfoundation.com/), Breeze will receive a plush orthopedic bed with her adoption!
