Raven is an affectionate girl who gives up kisses very enthusiastically.  She loves to walk on
a leash, and she stays right beside you.  While she is active, it is not excessive, and she
would fit into a home with either small active kids or older less active humans(she goes with the flow).
She loves being in her crate with the door open during the day and she comes and goes from it.
Late at night the crate is her safe place and thatâ€™s where you will find her.  She has mastered
stairs, and flies up and down them with ease.  She also likes to be in whatever room you are in.
She will usually find a cozy corner and lay down in the living room while you watch TV.
