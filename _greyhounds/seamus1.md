This sweet, curious, super friendly fellow is a leaner and occasionally gives kisses. He's perfectly house trained, crate trained and, once he knows his environment, mostly loose leash on walks. An enthusiastic eater, he's also very treat motivated. Heâ€™s currently living happily with two cats in his foster home. He's a collector of toys and footwear. Seamus is a lurcher (greyhound mix). His body is very greyhound-y with just a touch of something else as seen in his wide front paws and floppy ears. He is a gorgeous glossy black with snowy white patches on his neck, chest and the backs of his feet. 

Seamus has a genetic eye disease which does not affect his overall health, but will eventually affect his vision.
