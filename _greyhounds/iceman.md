A very well behaved hound who just wants to please his people. He is in good health, walks very well on a leash, and
gets along with other dogs. He settled into his foster home easily. He's so comfortable that he is often found cock
roaching on his dog bed! He is learning how to be an inside dog very quickly and has had no accidents in the house. He's
comfortable around adults and kids and seems to ignore small animals and cats on walks around the neighborhood.
