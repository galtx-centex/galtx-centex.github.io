Swifty is a super sweet, very alert little boy. He loves morning cuddles with his foster mom and dad and often ends up doing zoomies on the bed with excitement. Swift loves going on walks and would do best with an active family that will take him for at least one good walk a day. He is very active and the walks burn off his puppy energy. He also needs continued work with leash manners as he gets distracted by new things (and always by deer). His response to distractions is to freeze up and not move. He has gotten a lot better but definitely still needs work. While on leash, Swift has been working on "heel up," "go straight," "go right," "go left."

Swift is food motivated, but is often overzealous and tries to get the treat before it is his turn. He has responded well to commands "target" and "shake".  Swift has too much energy for apartment living. His foster mom calls him a guard dog because he always tells her when someone is approaching the house. Swift could live with other greyhounds or alone, but not with cats or small animals.  He would love nothing better than to be cuddled and adored, with a yard to bark and run circles to his heart's content.
