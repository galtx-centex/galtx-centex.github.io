Byrdie has been a great house guest. Her energy level at home is quite low - she enjoys lounging and sleeping, and the occasional poking around. She might just grab your slippers - not to chew on, but to lick and sleep with. One of Byrdie's quirks is that she explores her world with a lot of licking! When she meets other dogs, her energy is more that of a puppy - she's very playful! She enjoys running around with other dogs and has even done well on walks with much smaller dogs.  She is getting better on the leash; her prey drive has been very low, but she likes to stop and smell the roses and can be intimidated by large objects, like parked cars or dumpsters. She can startle easily and doesn't like loud noises like loud cars and vacuum cleaners. As she learns about and adjusts to her big new world she will most likely startle less and less. Byrdie has a healthy appetite, though she can be a bit of a messy eater because she eats quickly. Byrdie is a very sweet girl and an excellent companion, with a lot of love to give.
