This red-headed lad had a short racing career in Ireland, but is quickly adapting to life in Texas.  Conor is an outgoing, affectionate guy, who tackles new experiences with enthusiasm. He would do well in an obedience class to keep both mind & body occupied. Conor LOVES CARROTS and TX BBQ, but hates thunderstorms! He will make a loyal best friend for someone.
