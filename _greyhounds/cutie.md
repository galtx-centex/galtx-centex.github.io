She's got Bette Davis eyes! When you meet her you will understand. She also has some cute floppy ears. 

Cutie is not just a looker, she has a great personality, too. Fun and affectionate Cutie is house-trained and accustomed to being crated dutring the work day. She is getting better at leash walking - there are just so many distracting sights and smells, that she tends to zig and zag. She is a larger gal at 71 lbs., but doesn't pull, and loads in and out of the car without assistance. Cutie currently lives in harmony with another greyhound.
