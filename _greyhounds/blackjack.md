My name is Blackjack and I am a lucky dog!  I have so many people who care about me and brought me to safety when my owner could no longer provide for me.  I enjoy my mealtimes and snacks, short walks in my neighborhood, any and all forms of attention.  I am a big boy at 80 lbs, but not overweight; I also have a deep bark.  My physical appearance contrasts with my gentle, calm nature.  I get along with everyone and am happy to have a soft spot to crash with a nice family.  Climbing up the carpeted stairs was easy for me, but I am not as confident going down. Tile floors were a little scary at first, but I am easily motivated by food and desire to be near my people.  

From my foster mom: Blackjack will need to undergo Heartworm treatment before he will be available for adoption. If all goes well, he should be ready for his home in June.  He is on activity restrictions until then.  He has been a pleasure to have around and he learned our routines very quickly.
