Seth is a handsome, sweet goofball. He is fully vetted, about 75lbs, and ready for his forever home. He loves people and will follow you from room to room (FOMO!) Seth loves a good back scratching or belly rub; he uses his puppy-eyes to great effect when he lays his head in your lap for some loving. Seth would be your giant lap-dog given the opportunity. His favorite time of day is mealtime, the JOY is real, but walk time would be a close second. Seth also enjoys exploring the backyard and getting his zoomie on. He can expertly dissect the squeaker out of a toy. Seth listens well and is a fast learner. He is currently working on jumping into and out of the car without assistance. Seth enjoys the company of another greyhound in his current foster home.
