My official racing name was "Let's Go Girls" and I am pretty proud of my 31 finishes all around Victoria and New South Wales, Australia.  When my handlers decided to retire me, I said "let's go" to the USA where maybe I can meet Shania ;) 

So far, I haven't spotted any celebrities, but life is good here. My current foster family includes two other greyhounds and three school-aged human boys whom I adore.

She recently learned to use the doggie door, house-trained, crate-trained, eats well, walks nicely on leash, healthy and ready for her next adventure!  -JR
