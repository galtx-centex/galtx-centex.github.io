Timber is a very loving dog, and a nice smaller size for a male at 60 lbs. He is a charming mix of sighthound and scenthound, though he doesn't seem to have much hunting instinct either way.  He currently lives with a cat and a female greyhound. He will do best in a family with another dog, though it doesn't need to be a greyhound. 

Timber was previously adopted and has beautiful house manners.  He will go to the back and ring the jingle bells when he wants to go out.  Like many dogs, Timber is fearful of thunderstorms and fireworks. His morning sunbath in the yard, has become a favorite part of his day.
