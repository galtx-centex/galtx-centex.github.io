This lovely, special lady is approximately 7 years old, brought in with Carmelo as a stray from the San Marcos Animal
Shelter.  Thought to be a Smooth Coat Saluki & Greyhound Mix, Duchess is a former brood mama with a distinguished black
and grey coat  She has a few scars ...early in life she unfortunately did not receive the veterinary care and TLC she so
very much deserves.  She is on reserve in a doting foster home where she is gaining a little weight and learning to
trust a little more.  Her foster mother reports: "She’s wonderful on the leash...I’m giving her lots of hugs and gentle
scratches, but it’s going to take a little time to build up her trust."  She is heartworm negative, and has a sparkling
grin!  Duchess is friendly with other dogs, cat-testing pending; this royal lady deserves a loving, patient forever home
fit for a queen!
