Could Hillary be the perfect fit for your family? She might be if you're looking for one, not too young and not too old, just right at five years of age! 

Words that best describe Hillary include loving, smart, fun and loyal. When she greets her foster family, she goes to each person indiviually to ensure that no one gets left of the kisses. She loves long walks and playing with all types of toys. Chewing is high on her list of favorite pasttimes, so she will need lots of appropriate things to chew and items not intended for her should be put away. At times Hillary shows a little too much interest in the kitty, so will require close supervison if a cat is part of the family. Hillary is house-broken, kennel-trained and ready for her forever home.
