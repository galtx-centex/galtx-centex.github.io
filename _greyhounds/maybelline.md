Maybelline's personality is just starting to shine through. Her tattoos are difficult to read
so she may be five years old but we suspect she may be younger, maybe as young as three judging
by her teeth which are in great shape.  She is very happy to hang out in her crate but has just
discovered the joys of dog beds. She has  discovered squeaky toys and loves to collect them in
her crate to keep her company while she naps. She really enjoys just being outside or relaxing
in the grass. She and her host dog Zella, are always up for some full throttle zoomies around
the backyard before a leisurely puppy nap. She and Zella enjoy walks in the neighborhood and
she does well on her leash. She has shown no interest in getting on any of the furniture but
has done a little counter surfing now and then. She loves getting her neck rubbed and just
yesterday assumed the “roach” position for the first time. She really wants to please her
humans so is very responsive to a “no”. She is a real sweetie and full of puppy love.
Maybelline is a really easy dog and is looking forward to joining her forever family.
