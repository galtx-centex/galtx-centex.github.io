Justin Time (Justin) is a super sweet red fawn 60 lb. fellow looking for his forever home "Justin Time" for the
holidays!  He is a bit of a counter surfer, but easily correctable--putting away reachable food and and kind but firm,
consistent correction will help him get over the temptation of kitchen counters.
