Kouta is a retired athlete from Australia.  He was named for the talented Aussie footballer, Anthony Koutoufides.  Our Kouta is very handsome with his shiny black coat. He is quietly confident and attentive, wants to be wherever you are.  In fact, he could be called "Shadow" because every time you turn around, there he is.  He enjoys his daily walks, and squirrel-hunting in the yard.  We are working on not jumping and not counter surfing.  He is a quick learner and has improved greatly in only a few days.  He has never had a potty accident in his foster home.  Kouta is the whole package - looks, smarts, and personality!
