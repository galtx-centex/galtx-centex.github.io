Oakley has been an excellent house guest. He is definitely still puppy and would benefit from a
home with another younger dog for him to play with and a yard to run around in. His energy
level is about medium, but he is a major cuddle bug and loves to curl up with you on the couch.
He is well potty trained and has only had 3 accidents in the house (due to upset stomach most
likely). He is fully crate trained and knows lots of tricks. He is learning not to pull on the
leash but his harness helps a lot. He is very friendly with people and other dogs. Overall
Oakley is an excellent, sweet pup who brings so much love and personality and makes a lovely
companion.
