Nila has been a great house guest. Initially her energy level seemed quite low, but that seems to be because it took her some time to adjust to her new surroundings. Her energy level now seems to be low-medium. She loves to curl up on her bed and she has had no accidents inside. Nila  has so far only eaten food that is somewhat wet - completely dry food doesn't seem to agree with her (there has been a small amount of vomit a couple times). She has done very well on a leash. Nila gets excited when she sees other dogs, but she is most interested in other humans! She hasn't met a stranger yet - she will confidently approach anyone, even very small children, and stand still until they stop petting her. Overall, Nila is a very sweet girl and an excellent companion, with a lot of love to give.
