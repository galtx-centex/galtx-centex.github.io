Oreo is a beautiful girl who is an absolute joy to have around. She has a calm and composed demeanor around people and other dogs, including her little IG foster brother. Although she can be shy and reserved indoors, Oreo's personality transforms in the backyard, where she becomes an avid squirrel chaser, who loves to run and play. She is fully house-trained, and will relax in her open crate for a little downtime when not following her people around. Oreo loves going on long walks and exploring new places, but also has a laid-back style that makes her an ideal companion.
