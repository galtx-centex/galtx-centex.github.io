Lovely young gal with a gorgeous dark brindle coat, full of energy and excitement about the world of
retirement. She loves walks, and is learning leash manners with the help of her patient foster mom. Mongo is very smart
and has already learned several commands like come, no, mine, out, etc. and she knows how to use the dog door, and
enjoys regular walks and dog park time.
