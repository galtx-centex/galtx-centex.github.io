Beautiful brindle Chrissie takes a break after a long day of watching her foster dad doing household chores. Chrissie
(Race name "All I Want for Christmas") is just in time for the Easter Bunny.  Chrissie is a very loving, people-oriented
dog, and she is also friendly to other dogs. She probably will be cat friendly, but is curious and still needs some work
in that area.  Chrissie's diligent foster family is working with her on her separation anxiety & adjusting to life as a
pet. Till then, she's practicing for the opera!  Would you sing along with her?
