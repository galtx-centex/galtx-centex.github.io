Chaz is a charming ten year old guy (he kind of likes the ladies). He has no known medical issues and has been a great house guest in his foster home. Chaz likes long walks followed by long naps. He also rides well in the car.  He enjoys being the center of attention and would be a great choice for a retired person. Chaz would prefer to be an only dog at this stage of life.
