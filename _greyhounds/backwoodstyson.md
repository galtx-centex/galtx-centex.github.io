Backwoods Tyson is a tall, gorgeous 75 lbs. red brindle male with white chest and feet.  His striking good looks and
bouncing, silly personality make him a walking conversation piece.  Outgoing, playful and energetic, 15 month old Tyson
is more of a lover than a fighter--he loves meeting new people and is not shy at all!   Tyson retired early due to
playing/distracting other dogs while training for the racetrack.  Tyson likes to sing along with the radio in the car,
and is not a fan of being alone or crated; however, he is learning that when his foster humans leave, there's no reason
to cry--they always come back.  He is all boy: has a good appetite and energy to burn; Tyson would benefit from someone
who will have patience and consistency teaching this young fellow the rules of the house.  (Boys are sometimes messy,
you know, but always full of love!)  Great with other medium and large dogs, Tyson's cat and kid testing were
successful.  He would do well with older children and firm, loving adult(s) who are home to include him in daily
activities; best suited for in an active home with doggie companions.  A greyt candidate for doggie day care while
humans are away!
