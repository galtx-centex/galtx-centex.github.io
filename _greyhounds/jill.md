I'm a 2 year old girl who's very playful and fun loving. I get along well with my 2 greyhound foster siblings, so well that we all sleep in a giant dog bed together at night. I'm very good around children; I currently live with two 6 year olds in my foster home. I'm also crate trained. I'd love to find a home where I can play and go on walks and have a family of my own.
