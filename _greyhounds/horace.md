Hi, I'm Horace! You might remember my brother [Zander]({{ site.baseurl }}/greyhounds/zoolander).
I'm a lot like him--super cuddly, lovable and goofy.
I can't wait to be your new best friend! My favorite activities include lounging on
the couch, playing with my stuffed toys and following humans around. I have a really big and
quirky personality. I'm super laid back and don't mind being left alone if you have to leave.
I'm very smart and like to find hidden toys. I also love belly rubs!

I'm one years old and still adjusting to life as a pet. I'm learning to go on walks and go up
and down stairs so you might need to be patient with me while I learn how to be your best
friend. I do really well with other dogs of all sizes and breeds but I'm not keen on cats.
