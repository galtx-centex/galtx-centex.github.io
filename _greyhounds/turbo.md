Hi my name is Turbo. 
 
In the words of my role model Tigger: My top is made out of rubber, made bottom made out of springs!  I am most certainly bouncy, pouncy and flouncy fun!  However, I am a greyhound, not a Tigger, so those moments don’t last too long.  The rest of day, I enjoy naps, walks, and toys.  I can be rather vocal when I want your attention.
 
I have previously lived with cats and a small dog; we got along just fine.  Squirrels in the backyard are another matter.  Those rodents taunt me and I can’t help but chase them.  I do have a chronic condition which is being controlled with daily medication.
 
I am accustomed to staying in my crate when my humans are not at home. 
 
I hope to make your acquaintance at a Meet & Greet soon.
