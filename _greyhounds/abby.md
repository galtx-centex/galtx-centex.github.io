Abby is a tall, lovable 6 year old girl. She quickly learned about the couch and bed and LOVES them. She is house trained, very smart and settled into our routine quickly. She learns fast and with the help of positive reinforcement (read: treats!) I think she could learn a few commands.

Abby stays on her crate while I am gone, and while I have to encourage her with a little push to go into her crate, once there, she rests calmly and waits to be let out. Abby loves it when the humans get home and once out of her crate, shows her love by wagging her tale, jumping. On the occasions I’ve left Abby out of her crate while going out, she’s been very well behaved and naps until I’m back. I’m sure she would love this type of living arrangement!

Abby is very curious and when we are on walks she tries to sniff as much as possible. She has a high prey drive and needs a strong lead because if there is a cat/squirrel on sight she will try to go after it, or she’ll focus intensely without moving. I have found that obstructing her view works best, and she has gotten better at moving once I tell her to go. I’m sure she will improve in this area with time. She has never been inside with a cat, but I’m almost certain she wouldn’t be cat safe in that situation either.

Abby will not complain if she is inside cuddling with her humans all day, but also loves being outside roaming free in a yard or dog park. Abby learned to play ball from her foster brother really quickly and loves to chase the ball and make it squeak as much as possible. Inside the apartment, Abby gets bursts of energy and enjoys playing all the stuffies. She also loves to play tug of war with my greyhound and gets along great with him but I suspect she would be good as an only dog too.

When she first arrived to her foster home, Abby would growl when her foster brother would touch her in her sleep. She rarely does this anymore, but it could happen in a new environment. 
If you are looking for a gorgeous dog to cuddle with and give you lots of love, Abby is looking for you!
