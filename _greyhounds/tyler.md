I am a goofy, curious, and affectionate 4 year old boy. I love to explore the world, and even
try to get into the shower when it's running! I love being around people and am enjoying the
company of my greyhound foster brother. I do this silly thing where I sit for a few seconds
before I lay down, because I'm always doing silly things. I make my foster parents laugh a lot!
Would you be interested in being my forever family?
