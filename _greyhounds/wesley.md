Wesley is a sweet, submissive, affectionate boy who also has a fun, playful streak in him! Once he warms up to you- expect endless nuzzles, ear rubs, leaning, and tail wagging. As if on cue, if you crouch down he will immediately come bury his head in your arms or on your shoulder- almost like a hug! Wes has moderate prey drive which mostly translates to lots of interest in dog toys that make sounds, but cats and small animals probably wouldn’t mix well with him. He walks well on a leash and enjoys car rides. He has met elementary aged children and was kind and gentle. His foster mom thinks he’d do equally well in a family with playful kids/other dogs or in a more laid back environment.
