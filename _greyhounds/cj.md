Hi, my name is Calamity Jane, but my friends call me CJ.  
I enjoy going on walks with my foster mom and meeting new people at the pet store.  I am also content to be in my home, which I share with a couple of cats and another greyhound.  I have learned to go up and down steps, though it’s not my favorite form of exercise.   I have met some school-aged kids in the neighborhood. They might be fun.  My foster mom says I’m really smart and catch on quickly.  I won’t bother your furniture or pretty things, and know all about good house manners. 
I had 113 races during my three year career, beginning in W Virginia and then moving on to Florida.  Now I am retired at the age of five, and am ready for my next adventure. Could that be with you?
