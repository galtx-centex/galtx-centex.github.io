Daisy is eleven years YOUNG. She enjoys her daily walk and plays with her stuffed toys. As an adult dog, who has been a pet for several years, she is perfectly house trained, comfortable with stairs and different types of flooring, and wouldn't think of chewing on your table legs! No need for a crate. Daisy has big eyes and perky ears that give her an alert, inquisitive look. However, you will more likely view her in a beautiful, full roach position. 

Daisy had a recent veterinary exam with bloodwork and a full dental. There are no known issues at this time.
