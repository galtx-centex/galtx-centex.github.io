Nala has been a great house guest. Initially her energy level seemed quite low, but that seems to be because it took her some time to adjust to her new surroundings. Her energy level now seems to be low-medium. She loves to curl up on her bed and she has had no accidents inside. Nala  has so far only eaten food that is somewhat wet - completely dry food doesn't seem to agree with her (there has been a small amount of vomit a couple times). She has done very well on a leash. Nala gets excited when she sees other dogs, but she is most interested in other humans! She hasn't met a stranger yet - she will confidently approach anyone, even very small children, and stand still until they stop petting her. Overall, Nala is a very sweet girl and an excellent companion, with a lot of love to give.
