Harmony was an amazing racer and is not cat safe.  Already "in harmony" with her foster mom, she reported that, upon
coming home from the vet the first time in the house, "Harmony walked into the back yard on the leash, peed, pooped
respectably, then came into the house with me where I showed her the comfy crate and water dish. However, when I turned
around, she was up the stairs...explored the whole house, ate voraciously, and settled on quickly made-up bed in the
den, within sight of me (and possibly the kitchen). Has to be the most adaptable greyhound ever." Seems she's really
ready for retirement!  Harmony ran an astonishing 221 races. Let her run into your life!
