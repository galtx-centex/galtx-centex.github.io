An outgoing 12 month old 78 lb. male, Timothy is a gentleman in the house, sharing doggie beds with
resident female greyhound.  Timothy is a silly and playful boy--he quickly discovered toys and rearranged dog beds
within the first 24 hours in his foster home.  Timmy is recuperating from a race injury (small gash) on his foot, but
allows dressing changes and wears a protective boot on neighborhood walks.  Sutures should be out soon, and he takes his
antibiotics like a champ.
