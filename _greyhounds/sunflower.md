Sunflower is a stunning 18 month old fawn female with black "eyeliner". Cat-possible, Sunflower is 72 lbs. of sunshine!
Outgoing Sunflower is learning to accept treats--she never raced officially, fast-tracked to retirement due to a minor
"skip in her step", but the vet says it's a very early life development that likely prevented her from racing, but it
clearly doesn't slow her down at play time, she can run and keep up with everyone! Sunflower is an excellent car rider,
walks nicely on leash, and is probably best suited to a one-level home without too many stairs. She enjoyed her first
trip to Tomlinson's Pet Supply where she garnered lots of attention. Could Sunflower be the reason you have a skip in
your step? Make this sunny girl your forever friend today!
