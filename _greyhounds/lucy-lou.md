G'day mates! My name is Lucy-Lou. I am a 2 1/2 yr old cutie from down under! Some of my favorite things are food, toys, belly & ear rubs, and zoomies. Also, chewing shoes, counter surfing, stealing tissues from the trash, and barking at squirrels (those cheeky little bludgers!), but foster mom is trying to teach me "manners". I also like walks, car rides, and roaching in my crate. I am a petite 55 lbs. and would love to be your lap dog. Really, I am still a rambunctious puppy, but that's how us Aussies roll.
