I am a large brindle male with the most playful disposition! I love to play with my toys, and
I'm curious about everything. I can always find a way to play. Nothing seems to bother me. I'm
not afraid of the vacuum cleaner, loud noises or other typical things most dogs can shy away
from. I'm an expert at using the doggie door. I prefer to be in the same room as you, but I'm
not needy or suffer from separation anxiety. I get along great with every dog I've met, though
I haven't met small dogs or cats yet. I'm always super excited to see my foster mom when she
gets home from work, and I can't wait to meet my forever family.
