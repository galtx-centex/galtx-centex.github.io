Diamond has the confidence that comes with maturity. She could be an only dog, but will get along with other greyhounds also. This lady knows what she likes - chasing squirrels, getting up with the sunrise, eating, toys and ear rubs. She will express her impatience when her human servants don't anticpate her desires. 

Diamond is a little too curious with cats and small dogs. She is affectionate and house-trained. We will require a 6ft fence, as Diamond is quite a good jumper. We think Diamond is a real gem!
