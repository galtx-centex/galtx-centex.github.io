If you have ever wanted your own entourage, Rebel might be the dog for you. He always wants to have his foster mom in his sight, even when she's in the shower! He loves to cuddle and clearly wants to please. He crates wonderfully while foster mom is at work. Despite his youth, he is generally very calm around the house. He is fostered with an indoor kitty that he totally ignores (after the first few days). He likes to collect things that smell like foster mom, especially dirty socks, but isn't destructive with them.  His house-training is coming along very well but hasn't yet achieved perfection. He likes to chase his greyhound foster brother around the yard a few times but mostly wants to be inside fulfilling his entourage duties. He can be a handful on a leash but is learning leash manners and can spook when he hears loud noises.  He hasn't been around other breeds of dogs or outdoor cats. Foster mom thinks medium to large dogs will probably be fine.  He has met some kids and seemed to like them but given his dislike of loud noises, older kids would probably be better.
