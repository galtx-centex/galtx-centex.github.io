I am a large, young male who loves to play with my toys and hang out with my foster family. I've learned to climb stairs, play with squeaky toys, and go on little excursions. I love to go to dog friendly restaurants and bars and hang out! I would be a great companion as an only dog or with other dogs in the home. I have a mellow personality and like to be around people. I can't wait to meet my forever family!!
