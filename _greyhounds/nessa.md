Hi my name is Nessa. I raced under the name Atascocita Eagle.  My professional career lasted just one year, but then I came back to the farm to be a mother.  They say I am a senior at seven years old, but I say psshhh. . . that’s only a number!  My foster family describes me as independent and energetic. Now that I have retired and my kids have left the nest, I am ready to see what else is out there to explore. I love to play with toys and go for adventures with my foster family.  I do enjoy spending time with some skin kids that come by to visit me – they are so funny to watch.  Please do set some boundaries, as I might not understand which toys are okay for me to play with and which are not.   
This blonde bombshell is ready to meet you!
