At only 57 lbs, Red & White-Ticked CL Happy Jazz was a strong racer and after she hung up her track shoes, she became
a mom to a few litters of pups. The kennel owner's favorite, she truly lives up to her name:  happy, outgoing and
super-affectionate.  She loves ear rubs, and even moans to let you know you've found the right spot. She is currently
fostered with two small dogs and a younger male greyhound; Jazzy loves to explore the yard and is active and sweet.
You'd never know she's 9; this sassy senior is all jazzed up and ready for her forever home!
