This smart black beauty is a perfect lady. Her blood bank days are over! She is very
affectionate, always welcoming hugs and kisses.  Her high prey drive means no other dogs,
cats, or critters in her prospective home. She plays nicely with other greys, but is a breed
snob. She is good on lead, but if a smaller animal is in her path...well, best she has a good
sized yard in which to play. She loves doing zoomies with her foster sisters, being
respectful of space.
