Helena is a sweet girl who always has to be the first to be pet. She loves to play with her squeaky toys, sometimes while doing zoomies. She is very friendly and likes to get to know everyone. When she goes outside, she’ll run around for a bit and then take a nap in the sun. She walks well on leash unless she sees a squirrel she'd like to chase. She is happy to meet every person or dog on the street. She wants to play with her cat friends but will back off if warned and would do best with strong cat personalities. Helena is crate-trained, but much prefers comfy dog beds. If you let her, she would love to join you on the sofa (though not permitted to currently). She loves meal times and will try to get her paws on any type of food. Counter and table surfing are manners she is still working on. She is currently living with cats, school age children, and 2 senior greyhounds and enjoying everyone in this home life! Though her senior greyhound friends are a bit tired of her puppy energy and are hoping she’ll grow out of it or find her forever home soon. She would likely be OK as an only dog, but would love even more to have playmates.
