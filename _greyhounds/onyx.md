Onyx is a 3-year-old retired racer from West Virginia. This sweet and joyful girl took about 48 hours to go from farm hound to house hound, adapting quickly to a lively foster house with three boisterous kids (ages 9, 13, and 16) and two resident greyhounds. She is generally calm and well-behaved, and occasionally lets her adorable, playful energy shine through, entertaining her foster family with her pouncing and spinning. She loves going on walks (she’s still learning how to walk nicely on her leash) and will hip-check the resident hounds out of the way for a dog treat, but she does not beg for food or counter surf. She is not anxious, fearful, or clingy, like some greyhounds can be when adjusting to life in a house. Although, she clearly prefers to be around people and expresses unbridled joy when her foster family comes in the front door or greets her first thing in the morning. She is warm and friendly with everyone she meets and is generally unperturbed by loud noises or frantic activity, including screaming kids, flying soccer balls, and neighborhood friends running through the house. She hasn’t shown any interest in getting on the furniture, but loves the oversized, orthopedic dog beds. She will just as readily sleep on a pile of her foster mom’s yarn, which she likes to collect one yarn ball at a time.
