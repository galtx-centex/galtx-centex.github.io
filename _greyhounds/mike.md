If you want a buddy to hangout on the couch and watch the big game, Mike is your man. Mike loves people and is eager to snuggle or lean. He crates well, eats well, and walks nicely on leash. He loves soft, stuffed dog toys and will collect them all on his bed.

Mike is a lurcher, meaning a Greyhound mix.  He looks very much like a Greyhound in his body type and lovely red brindle coat, except for his floppy ears, that give him away.  Mike is working on his house manners, but he has been a delight to foster. 

I like Mike; I think you will, too!
