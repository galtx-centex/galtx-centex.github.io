Chin Chin is a seven year old female with a gorgeous fawn-brindle coat.
Her tail has been cropped to about 5 inches.
She has a longer than usual coat for a greyhound and is amazingly soft.
She was initially very skittish and easily startled by all the strange sights and sounds preferring to stay in her crate.
She has been getting more comfortable napping on a dog bed or on the carpet but is happy to go in her crate when asked.
She gets along very well with her host pup, Zella but has not been cat tested yet.
She is very sweet and is becoming more comfortable being petted.
She does exceptionally well on a leash and has discovered the joys of squeak toys.
Very soon, Chin Chin will be ready to go meet her forever family.
