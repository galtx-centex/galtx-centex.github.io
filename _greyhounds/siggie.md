I am a sweet brindle greyhound named Siggie. I'm currently living with a greyhound foster brother and a cat, and I get a long very well with both. I am very playful and curious, and love to be involved in my foster mom's plans. I'm a friendly and loving girl who would be happiest in a home with another greyhound. I'm looking forward to meeting my forever family!
