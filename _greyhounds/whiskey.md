Whiskey is a big, lovable lunk who wants to be your best friend. #Whatchadoin and #CanIcometoo are his favorite hastags.  His perfect family will be active, with a yard and another dog to run around with. Whiskey did not read the chapter which says greyhounds are quiet, couch pototoes. He is a ton of fun and super friendly, even with cats. He may be 80 lbs., but still thinks he is a lap dog! You will likely meet many new acquaintences when you walk this good-looking extrovert.
