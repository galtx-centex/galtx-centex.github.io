Five-year-old Erin is a very lovable and adaptable female who made herself at home within the first 30 minutes of her
arrival with her foster family. She vigorously wags her tail almost constantly and gets along well with other dogs. She
seems to be a fast learner and should quickly catch on to the routines and rules laid out by her new family. She loves
being with people and will be a dog who sticks with you when you are home. She will sleep in a crate at night, but
prefers not to. She is not cat-friendly and has not yet been small-dog nor child tested. She is a large female who won
numerous races in her career.
