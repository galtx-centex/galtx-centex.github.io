I'm a quiet and timid 3 year old girl who likes to rest and relax on my dog bed. I especially love when my foster parents come over and pet me. But when it's time for walks, I get really excited! I love exploring and seeing the world, and if I'm at home, I love looking out the window. I'm getting along well with my foster brother, who's also a greyhound. I'd live best in a home without cats.
