Tia has a gorgeous, glossy coat and a winning personality! She had a stellar racing career, at one point winning 13
races in a row. Just as she was a queen on the track, she wants to be the diva dog in your home. She would do best
with a male dog or is confident enough to be an only dog. She is very people oriented and will cuddle and kiss.
