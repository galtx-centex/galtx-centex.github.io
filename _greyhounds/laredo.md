Laredo is a beautiful female, black with white markings.  Her head is especially delicate and her eyes eagerly look around for someone to play with or look into the eyes of a human, making important contact.  She is smart, eager to please, and playful as a two year old!  She enjoys being with humans and other greyhounds but she also enjoys going to her own crate in the crate room,  away from the main living area for some alone time.

She quickly adapted to the routine of the two older greyhounds she is living with as a foster. She is interested in finding items to chew in the house and the backyard and is good at sneaking objects in for chewing!  Black plastic from lighting in the garden is a favorite as well as large "bones" filled with treats.  She responds quickly to "no".
