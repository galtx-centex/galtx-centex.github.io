This sweet, gorgeous girl is just 18 months old -- she just didn't want to race, so came into the adoption program early.

She was initially very scared when she came into home life, but she has warmed up amazingly.  She's still a bit timid, but just loves getting loved on and wants to be with her people.  

She is fantastic with other dogs -- large and small -- and gets along great with the 3 other dogs in the house.  They're teaching her how to play, and she's discovered that stuffed toys are just awesome -- especially those with squeakers!  We don't have cats, but I suspect she is cat friendly, as she really has shown no prey instinct.

She's got super cute mannerisms and chatters her jaw when excited.  She can also be cajoled into "rooing", and will tell you when she wants to go out.  
 
Come meet sweet Selena and find out why we think she's just wonderful.
