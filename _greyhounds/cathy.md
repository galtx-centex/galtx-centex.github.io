Somewhat shy young gal with no official races; her behavioral assessment and specialized conditioning has helped this
lovely girl start come out of her shell and she is always excited to see her human fosters come home every day, greets
everyone with kisses, bowing and tail wags.  She loves the dog park, is learning to like meet and greets, and shows
correctable interest in chasing squirrels. This "copy cat" is most suitable for a household with companion dogs, she
sulks if alone.  She is shy of children and anyone who rushes in too quickly--she warms up fast once she gives the
"sniff of approval." Cat-possible, older-child possible.
