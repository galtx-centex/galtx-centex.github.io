Stan Lee is a lurcher, meaning he has greyhound mixed with some non-sighthound genes; his appearance is very much like our Greyhounds though. He is a sweet, sensitive soul with very low prey drive.  He currently lives with a cat and another sighthound mix.  He has had only limited contact with children, but has such a nice demeanor, we think he could be a good choice for a family dog. At 65-70 lbs, he is not too big, not too small - he thinks he should be your lap dog!
