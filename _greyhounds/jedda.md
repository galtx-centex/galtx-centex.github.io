Jedda loves to follow everyone around the house. She is very gentle and always looking to get her head scratched and petted. She is a very curious girl and explores every corner her little nose can reach! Getting comfortable comes with ease for her and snuggling is her forte! Overall she is a good girl and will follow your lead anywhere you take her!

Thanks to a generous grant from [The Petfinder Foundation](http://www.petfinderfoundation.com/), Jedda will receive a plush orthopedic bed and a supply of Heart Worm prevention with her adoption!
