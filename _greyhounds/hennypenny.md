Penny is a lover/leaner with adults and kids and even the veterinary staff. She has a soft coat that just begs to be
touched. However, she does take her breeding and racing training to heart and should not be placed with little fluffy
critters. The temptation is just too much. She gets along just fine with the other greys and her neighbor German
Shepard. She is just beginning to play with toys and crates well overnight. She is quiet and easy to get along with
(unless you're a bunny!)
