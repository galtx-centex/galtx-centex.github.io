I was recently found as a stray and brought to GPA by a kind stranger. I'm recovering from
having some teeth removed and a torn toenail at the moment, and should be feeling better soon.
I am the sweetest girl with huge brown eyes. I get along very well with the other greyhounds
and humans in my foster home. Once I make a full recovery, I can't wait to meet my forever family!
