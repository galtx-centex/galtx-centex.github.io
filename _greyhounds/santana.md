At 5 1/2 years and 60 lbs, cat-curious white and brindle-ticked Santana is a true sweetheart. Following 56 races and
mothering 10 pups, Santana is ready for retired life in the city.  She is outgoing, independent, and motivated by both
treats and affection.  She lives with her foster humans in an apartment, and is mastering her stairs skills. She has
been successfully crated with no house-training accidents, and likes a regular schedule--she has even been a four-legged
alarm clock in the mornings for her foster humans!  She is a bit of a "roo-er", and will let you know when it's time to
go out for a walk. "Oye como va" indeed!
