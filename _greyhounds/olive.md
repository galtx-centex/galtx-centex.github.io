Olive is beautiful and extremely soft 1.5 year old female.  She is active, alert, and open and accepting of strangers (visitors).  She loves to collect a variety of objects (glasses, remotes, computer mouse, socks, shoes, etc….) and take to her bed.  Olive has been tested twice with cats and tolerates them very well.  She is fostered with a cat, two dachshunds, an Australian shepherd, another greyhound, and three goats.  Olive has a sweet disposition that is challenged with smaller dogs; however she enjoys the company of other greyhounds.  She has had a few incident of wetting inside the house, however is getting better.  Olive is a girl that will stand-up for herself and won’t be pushed around or bullied by other dogs.  Oh,...and she loves to eat.
