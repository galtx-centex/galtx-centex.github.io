I'm a sweet 5 year old brindle girl who is very, very affectionate. I love to cuddle and give kisses. I'm a great sleeper, a good eater, and I'm very polite and gentle. I have a foster greyhound brother who I get along very well with. I'm looking for a forever home with someone who wants a constant companion to love them.
