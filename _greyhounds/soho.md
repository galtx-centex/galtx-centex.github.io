Soho has taken to family life like she was born for it... and maybe she was! After all, at less than 18 months old, the professionals decided racing life was not for her. While she was pretty scared leaving the vet to go to a house for the first time, in just days she settled right in. Stairs, windows, hard floors, and vacuum cleaners have been no problem from the get go. Cats on the other hand were a little scary at first, until she realized they are not really tiny terrible fur monsters - now she's perfectly willing to share her people and petting with the resident felines - she just wishes they'd PLAY with her!

At 18 months old, Soho definitely still has some puppy energy, but also a greyhound's love of leisure. She'll willingly wade through the shallow creek to keep up with our daughter, or walk the neighborhood and trails with me, and she has fun at dog parks, but her very favorite things to do are hanging out at home and having active playdates with the neighbor's lab. In fact, she's learning to fetch (somewhat) from by playing with her doggy neighbor!

Soho tends to respond to new situations with a bit of hesitation, but she'll take her cues from her people, and she learns fast. In fact, look what I found today:
