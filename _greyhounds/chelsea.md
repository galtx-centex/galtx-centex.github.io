Chelsea is a super sweet and loving girl who has made so much progress since we began
fostering her a month ago! She is affectionate and enjoys being close to people. She loves
burying her head in your chest for those extra snuggles. She has adjusted very well to being
in a home. She still doesn’t seem to like sudden movements or loud noises, but once comforted
a little she is back to her happy self.

She gets along with our own grey (even if ours is used to being the queen of the castle and
gets a little testy with Chelsea sometimes), and seems to be good around others dogs as well.
She is definitely at least cat curious when we take her on walks and she sees a kitty. She
hasn’t shown any signs of aggression toward them though. We haven’t seen her around children,
but I can only imagine she would do just great as long as they are gentle with her.
Rambunctious kids might freak her out a bit at first, but as mentioned she seems to adapt
well over time.

She does well in her crate and goes in there on her own most of the time. She even roaches in
there! Chelsea would be a great addition to any household and would make a loyal best friend
to all those in her adoptive family!
