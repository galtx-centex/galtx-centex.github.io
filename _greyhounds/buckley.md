I am a newly retired young male who ran my last race just this January! However, I’ve quickly adapted to life in a home and enjoy lounging around with my foster siblings, even the cats! I get along with everybody and have a pleasant disposition. 

I am very smart and can learn new behaviors quickly. When I want to go on walks, I put my foster parent’s shoes by the door, because I learned that they put their shoes on before we go outside. I’m perceptive like that. 

I’m looking for a forever home with a soft bed and fun owners who will introduce me to all the good things life has to offer!
