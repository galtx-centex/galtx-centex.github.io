Gregory crossed the rainbow bridge peacefully after his 13th birthday. He was the Kumar family's first companion dog.  He went by many names- Sir Gregory, G-man, Greggy - always sweet, graceful, and a calming presence, especially in his later years becoming the "elder statesman." Gregory became their mentor, teaching patience, and how to live in the moment.  He will always be the omnipresent soul of their home.
