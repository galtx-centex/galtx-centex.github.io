I'm a 4 year old boy who is so curious about everything in life! Exploring is my favorite thing, and I love learning new things. I also love to go on walks, eat my breakfast and dinner, and just be loved. I live with a cat and a greyhound in my foster home right now, and get along famously with both. Deep down, I'm just a goofy, confident boy! I can't wait to meet my forever people.
