Cordelia is adapting quickly to pet life.  Already a total pro at stairs and sliding glass doors, she is house-trained and crate-trained and walks well on leash.  She bonds readily with her humans, following them from room to room.  She loves getting pets and rubs.  Cordelia is learning which things are okay to chew on (Kong, squeaky toys), and which are not (cords, cleaning cloth).  Her favorite activities are eating, and playing with toys (ahem, killing all squeakers).  Her foster parents are teaching her to “wait” and “leave it”.  However, all bets are off if a squirrel dares to cross her path.   

Cordelia is on medical hold while waiting for corrective dental surgery.
