Almost all white, Holly has spots on her ears and a very distinct black spade marking just above her long white tail.
She came in a little underweight but has started eating really well now that she's getting more comfortable in her
attentive foster home.  She definitely would like a home with other dogs. Also, with human males. She LOVES men and gets
completely girly and flirty when one is around. Sheâ€™s very much a curious puppy and a collector.
