Forrest is a happy, energetic, approx. 1 yr. old Saluki/Greyhound mix, who still has plenty of puppy energy to go around. He came to GALT Central Texas in March as an extremely shut down, shy pup who was relinquished with several others to the animal shelter. He came out of his shell within days of moving to a loving foster home. He is a bit timid at first but warms up quickly and loves to cuddle and play with his people. He is cat and small dog friendly, house and crate trained and walks well on a leash.  He still likes to chew so keeping a close eye on him, plenty of exercise and chew toys to redirect him to when the “land shark” comes out, will help him through this phase. He will thrive in a home with adopters who are very active, experienced with puppies and have time to take him to some obedience or agility training to help focus his energy.  He is full grown at approx. 50lbs.
