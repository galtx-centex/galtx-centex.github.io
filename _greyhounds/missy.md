Missy is figuring out life on this side of the globe.  Recently arrived from Australia, Missy doesn't require a lot of exercise, and will let you know when she needs to go out.  Currently, she is on a special food, but this might not be necessary long term. Missy loves attention from her humans, and is very affectionate.  So far, she prefers to get ALL of your love, without other pets in the home.
