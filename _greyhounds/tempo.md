Life moving at a hectic pace?  Slow down the Tempo with a chill boy like me!  I will make a trusting companion.  I sport a handsome caramel colored coat and have very effective, pleading eyes.  Crates are okay by me.
The only thing that causes me to lose my cool, is a small, darting animal.  I still have a strong chase instinct and am not to be trusted with cats, hamsters, and the like.  Squeaky toys are a fun substitute though.  Letâ€™s hang out together.
