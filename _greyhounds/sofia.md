Ms. Sofia is pretty great. She's amazing with kids and cats. She honestly shows no interest in the cats and she may even be a little scared of them 😂 She loves to be loved. She does seem to have a bit of separation anxiety so if someone leaves, she will walk around whining for them. She has had zero accidents in the house and will go to the backdoor and whine if she needs to go out. She goes upstairs without any fuss but going down she does need someone to walk with her, otherwise she'll turn around and go back up! She loves her crate. She is probably the laziest dog I've ever seen. She's either asleep on her bed in our living room or asleep in her crate. She's very sweet.
