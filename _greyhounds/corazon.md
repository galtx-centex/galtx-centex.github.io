Officially named Slatex Albany, we call her Corazon because she came to us on Valentine's day.  After 155 races in her career, and then 11 registered offspring, this lady deserves some pampering. A bit shy at first, she does enjoy the company of other dogs and people. On cool, crisp mornings, our canine classic has a spring in her step as she explores the yard. Later, she enjoys a good meal and relaxes in the parlor. Cora is house-trained and knows how to use a doggie door. 
Her ideal family would include other younger dogs, but no cats.
