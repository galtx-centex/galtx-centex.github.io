I am a super sweet and shy 2 year old boy. My name is James Bond because I have a sly smile and tuxedo coat. I'm pretty timid right now and am still getting comfortable in my surroundings, but I'm lucky to have the best foster family to show me the way. My favorite things are exploring the back yard, laying in my crate to rest, and getting some love from my foster parents. I can't wait to meet my forever family!
