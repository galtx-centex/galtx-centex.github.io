Fiona loves her toys and is a “busy” dog. She likely will go well in an active family, and currently is fostered by
a family with a large active dog. Cat testing was mixed – she showed signs of interest, but distractible by toys.  She
can use a "magic-screen" door and is a happy-go-lucky personality.  She is currently learning how to use stairs and
recently learned how to ask to "go-out".  Kid-possible, Fiona's foster home includes older children.
