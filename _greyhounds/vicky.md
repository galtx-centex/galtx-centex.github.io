Vicky is a beautiful brindle girl with bright eyes and a cheeky mohawk - the perfect symbol of her sweet and spicy personality.

Vicky is shy and skittish on the surface, but once she learns to trust you, she is a playful and sassy girl. She would love to have a yard to run around in, but also walks nicely on leash. Vicky would do best in a household with a mentor dog, and a little patience and experience. She enjoys being around her pack - both the human and animal kind. She does do well in a kennel if needed. Vicky is food motivated, which makes the transition process a lot easier. 

If you adopt her, your patience will be rewarded with a truly special dog.
