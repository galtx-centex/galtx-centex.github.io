Hi!  My name is supposedly "U Too Alexis", but my foster human calls me random things like "sweet girl", "Mama", and "Lexi". What would you call me?

I'm 6 years old, have had a successful past career and even gave birth to a litter of puppies. If you had to guess, you might think I'm closer to 3 because I still have plenty of energy.  I'm NOT hyper, but I can get restless after a nap. I think 3-4 short walks is just right while living in an apartment. Proud to say I recently tackled the three flights of open-back stairs. I'd be a really good fit for a family of 2 or more, with plenty of toys, and puzzles to keep me entertained.  I also love playing fetch!  
 
My foster human worked from home, but when he left the house for a couple hours or came home, he didn't make a big deal out of it, so it didn't bother me at all.  If you have to leave me alone for longer periods of time, I probably can handle it but you might have to help me get used to it and give me stuff to do.

I'm still a little shy, so patience is key with me, but please don't mistake my insecurity with stubbornness.  I just need you to show me what you want and I'll eventually get it.  Things like other dogs, cats, or children are fine by me.  The more things to snuggle with, the better.  I love cuddles, belly rubs, and pats on the butt get me awfully riled up!
