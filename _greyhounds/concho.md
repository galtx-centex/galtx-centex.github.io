I’m a sweet and goofy 4 year old boy. I really know how to relax and can often be found laying on my back with my feet straight up in the air. I would do well in a home as an only dog, or with other dogs, as I have a friendly demeanor. I’m a big boy, weighing about 80 pounds, but I’m a gentle giant and have already outgrown my puppy energy. I’m eager to please and would love to find a home with some folks who want my companionship.
