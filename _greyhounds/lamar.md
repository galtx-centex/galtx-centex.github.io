Don't let the _grey_ in this greyhound fool you; I'm only six years old and lots of spunk left in
me.  I'm a bit shy when I first meet someone, but a few treats and ear scratches and I'm all
yours!  I like other dogs, but if a small animal runs, I can't help but chase it.  I like
plush, squeaky toys and things I can chew on. My favorite toy right now is a squeaky ball my
foster mom got me. I don't like it thrown over my head, but I'll chase it and squeak it until
the puppy steals it from me.  I like older, quieter kids; the little ones who scream and run
around scare me, but I'm still quick enough to run away and hide by my foster mom.  My perfect
home would be adults or a family with older children and another dog I can play with. A yard
isn't totally necessary as long as I get good walks and a trip to the dog park every now and
then.
