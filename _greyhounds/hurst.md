I'm a sweet 4 year old boy who loves to go on walks and play with my toys. I get really excited about any toy, and I've even been known to cuddle with my food bowl while I sleep. I'm a happy go lucky greyhound who's looking for a fun person to adopt me. I am very satisfied with my daily walks and walk well on a leash, but if you are the jogging type, I can be your running buddy. I'm getting along very well with my foster family and my foster greyhound sister. I'd live best in a home without cats. I'm a smart boy who figures things out quickly, and likes to explore my surroundings. Oh, and I love to give kisses too. Hopefully I'll find my forever home soon!
