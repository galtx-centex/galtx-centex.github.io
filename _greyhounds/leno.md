If you want a big loveable boy, then Lenny is your man. He’s so sweet and likes to snuggle.
Lenny LOVES cheese (as seen in the photo below.)  Even though he has few teeth left, he does
love the harder treats as well.   He’s not a fan of the stairs even though he did go up a few
times, but has no problems with the few outside steps on the deck.  Hasn’t really played with
toys, but enjoys playing with other dogs.  He is cool with the cats and learned how to use the
doggie door in record time.
