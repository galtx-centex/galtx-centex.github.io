Elsa arrived with her friend Snowy at the Austin Animal Center.  Although not nearly as thin as he, she was full of parasites, including a heavy load of Heartworms.  Thanks to her emergency foster family, her anemia has resolved and she has gained enough weight to push forward with necessary medical procedures.

Elsa is learning all about the softer side of life; shag carpets are the bomb!

The treatment to restore these dogs back to health will be expensive and require months of care.  If you would like to help with a donation for Elsa’s care, please click the “Sponsor Me” button below.
