Cat-safe and calm in public, this little lady is a pint-sized dream. Gidget came to us with an injury, and after vet
treatments and several weeks of TLC, she has nearly completely recovered and all fur has nearly grown back--she looks
great!  And what a distinctive face!  She'd love to be your pal for playtime in the yard, errands around town and lazy
summer days.
