GALT-Central Texas is a chapter of [Greyhound Adoption League of Texas Inc.](http://galtx.org),
a national 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

Our mission is to find responsible loving homes for greyhounds, to acquaint the
public with the desirability of greyhounds as pets and to inform them of the
availability of greyhounds for adoption.

We place all dogs in foster homes upon coming into our group.  This helps us
get to know the dog and their personality before they go to their home.
We pride ourselves in helping you pick the perfect dog.  While the dogs are at
their foster home, they are taken to the veterinarian to get spayed or
neutered, all their shots, have their teeth cleaned, and heartworm tested.
During this time, they are also evaluated for injuries or health problems.

We host Meet & Greets at different pet stores and other locations to show off
our greyhounds and to let people know what good pets they make.  If you are
looking for a good, healthy, wonderful dog as a pet, please consider adopting a
greyhound.
