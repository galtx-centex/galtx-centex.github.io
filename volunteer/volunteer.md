Ongoing, we always need help with events and communications!

We have great momentum going forward and would hate for the efforts and generosity of so many members be lost. We had
49 successful adoptions last year and 14 already this year. Our bank account is the healthiest it has been for some
time. Please send an email of interest or if you would like information about any of these positions or have a
suggestion for another way you can participate, please contact: secretary@gpa-centex.org

Please consider donating your time, giving your experience to the benefit of the greyhounds we all love so much! Thank
you from the GPA-CenTex Board!
