I'm an adorable 1 year old greyhound mix. I am the sweetest girl and very affectionate with my foster family and my foster greyhound brother. I love to play and would do best with another dog in the home who also loves to play! I love to give kisses and hugs and lay in my human's laps on the couch. I'm very well behaved indoors and have great manners. I can't wait to find someone to love forever.
