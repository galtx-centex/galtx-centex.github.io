I'm a gentle gentleman named Waco. I was found as a stray in the Waco, Texas area a couple of months ago, and adapted quickly to home life in my foster home. I'm living with small dogs and cats, and we are one big happy family. I’m ready to meet my forever family!

**Update:**

Thanks to a generous grant from [The Petfinder Foundation](http://www.petfinderfoundation.com/), Waco will receive a plush orthopedic bed and a one year supply of Heartworm prevention with his adoption!
