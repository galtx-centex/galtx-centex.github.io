Jet is a newly retiring 3.5 year old male, red fawn fellow, looking for a place to call home.  He ran 25 races and
won a few, but now he's out of jet fuel, so his racing days are over.  Jet is currently being treated for a limp (likely
racing injury) by our caring veterinarians, so watch for updates on handsome JetPet!
