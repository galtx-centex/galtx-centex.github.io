I'm Felix, a goofy, happy boy. I am part Greyhound, part Saluki, so I have a bit of long hair
around my ears and tail. My birthday is unknown, but the vet thinks I'm about 6. I currently
live with 2 foster cats and am looking for a forever home with someone who has lots of love and
attention to give me.
