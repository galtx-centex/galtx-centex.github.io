They call me Mary, not Mary Mary quite contrary, nor Mary Mack for I have no buttons down my back.  My official name is Queen Mary.  With a formal title like that, you might imagine me to be haughty.
I may seem aloof at first, but truthfully, it is because I am a bit shy.  Once  you have proven your mettle,  I shall vow loyalty to you for the rest of my days.  You may rub my royal chin and ears in exchange for my oath of faith.
