I am a sensitive, sweet fawn girl who loves to run around the yard with my foster siblings. 

My favorite things are ear scratches, and I’ve quickly learned how to snuggle on the couch with my foster mom. I’m a little shy, so it takes me a bit to come out of my shell, but I will steal your heart in a minute. 

I am looking for a forever home with an owner who will show me new things in the world and just enjoy being together.
