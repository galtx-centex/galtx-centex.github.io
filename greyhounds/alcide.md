I'm a 16 month old male who's retired early due to having no interest in racing! However, I absolutely love toys and I love to play. I'm getting along really well with my 2 greyhound foster brothers and human parents. I'm a curious boy who wants to explore the world! I've also recently discovered that I love scratches and belly rubs. I'm looking for an active home with a family that wants to show me lots of love.
