Wanna play? huh? huh? I am a happy, goofy guy looking for a fun, active family.  Kids and dogs are great - the more the merrier!  
I had a head injury when I was very young that makes me rather uncoordinated.  I am smart and determined though; if I can't do something, I keep trying until I figure out my own way.  I quickly figured out that human contact is where it's at, so I taught myself how to climb into the family bed.  My foster mom screamed with pride!
From the humans: Zander might be more work than the other dogs, but you will be well rewarded with affection from this love sponge.  Oh and that scream might have been shock and pain when he landed on top of me, but yes, lots of pride at his accomplishment.
