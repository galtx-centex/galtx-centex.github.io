With heavy hearts, we say good-bye to Doc.  He was loved by Curtis and Keisha French for the
past ten years.  This brindle boy raced back on the East Coast under the name Ceelect.  When he
was ready for retirement, Greyhound Rescue in West Virginia took him in and found him a
wonderful family.  The early days and weeks were stressful due to his high prey drive toward
the family cats.  Eventually, he learned to live in harmony with the kitties (after a
well-placed swat from one.)  He also learned that playing in the snow is a blast!  His family
grew with fur-kids and skin-kids; they relocated to the Austin area where he frolicked in
bluebonnets instead of white powder.  He just recently celebrated his thirteenth birthday.  So
many experiences, don’t you wish he could have penned his story?
