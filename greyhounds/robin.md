Cheerful Robin has quickly learned to enjoy the softer side of life. She is thriving on her foster mom's home-cooking
and looks quite different from the skinny girl we pulled from the shelter. Although she is tattooed, her numbers are
illegible. She has a gentle, friendly nature, and has been a perfect house guest.
