Cora is turning out to be a great houseguest in her foster home. She is learning to play with toys and is friendly to
the other dogs in the house. She also is cat friendly, constantly wanting to lick her foster family’s resident cat. She
is smart and is a fast learner. She seems to prefer the company of people, and is very affectionate. She will stay the
night in a crate although she would prefer to sleep on the floor. She has not yet learned the joys of sleeping on
furniture.
