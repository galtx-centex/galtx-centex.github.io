Mr. Rocket is VERY excited for life off the track! He loves to give kisses and hugs. He is an avid water drinker (We have never seen a dog drink as much water as he does). He is super super sweet and good with other dogs. He is very obedient and will come to you anytime his name is called. He is the BEST doctor's patient and has no problem downing a pill. He is super lovable (and loving) and very much a wonderful dog!
