Coal might be a diamond in the rough. He is a mischievous two-year-old who has calmed down over time in his foster home
and is learning to be a great house dog. A beautiful, black greyhound with white markings, Coal gets along great with
other dogs. He likes to be with his people, especially at walk time. He works well on a leash. Although he is OK with
children, he can be stressed by them at times and might enjoy living in a home with adults, or possibly with older kids.
Coal has a high prey drive and is not cat friendly. He is fearful of thunder but calms himself by going into his crate.
He is working through some minor behavior issues while in his foster home, but he is a happy-go-lucky dog with a lot of
puppy left in him, and should provide his new family with years of love and companionship.
