Handsome Abnar is a 3 year old, 70 lb. retired racer who won 9 races in his short career.  He is probably cat safe, and
enjoys showing off his sleek, shiny coat on walks with his foster dad--Abnar is another greyhound proving that
greyhounds are the perfect apartment dog!  He is an excellent car rider and quickly bounced back from his neuter and
dental procedures, and is ready to find his forever home.
