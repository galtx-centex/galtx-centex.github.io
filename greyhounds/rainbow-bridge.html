    <h1>The Rainbow Bridge</h1>
    <p>
    By the edge of a woods, at the foot of a hill,<br>
    Is a lush, green meadow where time stands still.<br>
    Where the friends of man and woman do run,<br>
    When their time on earth is over and done.<br>
    For here, between this world and the next,<br>
    Is a place where each beloved creature finds rest.<br>
    On this golden land, they wait and they play,<br>
    Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day.<br>
    No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness,<br>
    For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness.<br>
    Their limbs are restored, their health renewed,<br>
    Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued.<br>
    They romp through the grass, without even a care,<br>
    Until one day they start, and sniff at the air.<br>
    All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back,<br>
    Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack.<br>
    For just at that instant, their eyes have met;<br>
    Together again, both person and pet.<br>
    So they run to each other, these friends from long past,<br>
    The time of their parting is over at last.<br>
    The sadness they felt while they were apart,<br>
    Has turned into joy once more in each heart.<br>
    They embrace with a love that will last forever,<br>
    And then, side-by-side, they cross over&#8230; together.<br>
    </p>
