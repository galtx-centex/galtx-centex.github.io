I am a bit shy and nervous in new surroundings, and would love to have a greyhound sibling to help me adjust.  Once I get comfortable, I am a happy, hoppy girl!  My foster mom says I have a “helicopter tail.”   I love to go for long walks in the neighborhood and just recently learned to conquer the scary stairs.  Kids are fine, (but I may chew up a Lego or two.)  I am gentle and quiet  and will wait by your side while you work at the computer. I can’t wait to meet my forever family!
