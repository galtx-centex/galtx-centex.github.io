Alyann is an absolutely beautiful five-year-old fawn brindle with a personality to match. This former brood mama was a
winner in several races. She is quiet and independent but at times acts like a puppy, playing with toys and clearly
enjoying her new life. She demonstrates the tolerance of her years when dealing with her rambunctious greyhound puppy
roommate. She has adjusted well to living in a home environment and will be the perfect companion for a family wanting a
laid back greyhound with plenty of youthful years left. She has not yet been cat tested.
