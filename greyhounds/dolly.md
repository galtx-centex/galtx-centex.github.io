Someone asked Santa for a doll for Christmas, he brought her...was it you? Dolly had a successful racing career, ran
in 25 races before suffering a broken toe which cut short her racing career; these days, she enjoys short walks and
playing with toys. After racing, she had a few puppies, and is now ready for retirement. Her personality truly lives
up to her name: she's an absolute doll, very confident, cheerful and sweet, wags her tail and gives kisses to almost
everyone she meets. She's outgoing, smart, housebroken and well-behaved, can be crated and likes her own space for
mealtimes. Dolly is learning to use stairs in her foster home, and could be a good candidate for a single-dog
household.
