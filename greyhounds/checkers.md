At 65 lbs, tall, sleek, and elegant tuxedoed Checkers may just be the smartest, sweetest and most easy-going greyhound
you've ever met. Cat-possible \“TK Checkered Flag" ran in 57 races before becoming a mother to 14 pups.  She's been
perfect in the house, no house-training accidents and likes walks. At 7 years young, she is always chipper and in
good spirits, likes her quiet time in the crate at night, quite possibly the easiest hound to have around. She's
waving the checkered flag, and waiting for you at the finish line!
