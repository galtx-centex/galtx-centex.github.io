Race name Charging Warrior, Charlie is an active, handsome brindle boy who is returning to GPA through no fault of his
own. He has lived successfully in an apartment before. Charlie is accustomed to being crated with regular walks several
times each day. Charlie is definitely cat safe: he does not chase the cat, he will only moan if she is in his face and
taunting him. He avoids nearby cats that are outside, even moans loudly when he sees them and walks away from them, but
is curious about squirrels, birds, etc. Curious about his environment, Charlie is a bit of a counter surfer and trash
digger, but this is easily correctable. He is not a great eater but will respect another dog's food or space, and while
initially nervous around unfamiliar dogs, he is more confident with another greyhound. An excellent car rider, goes
right to sleep. Charlie would love a home with an understanding, patient person who can devote time to socializing him
and perhaps offer him a canine companion. He is seeking a forever home that can offer him regular walks and play time in
the yard or at a dog park.
